## Configuration

Operators can configure indexing via the  `[tx_index]`  section. The  `indexer`  field takes a series of supported indexers. If  `null`  is included, indexing will be turned off regardless of other values provided.

```
[tx-index]

# The backend database to back the indexer.
# If indexer is "null", no indexer service will be used.
#
# The application will set which txs to index. In some cases a node operator will be able
# to decide which txs to index based on configuration set in the application.
#
# Options:
#   1) "null"
#   2) "kv" (default) - the simplest possible indexer, backed by key-value storage (defaults to levelDB; see DBBackend).
#     - When "kv" is chosen "tx.height" and "tx.hash" will always be indexed.
#   3) "psql" - the indexer services backed by PostgreSQL.
# indexer = "kv"
```

KV
The kv indexer type is an embedded key-value store supported by the main underlying CometBFT database. Using the kv indexer type allows you to query for block and transaction events directly against CometBFTâ€™s RPC. However, the query syntax is limited and so this indexer type might be deprecated or removed entirely in the future.
