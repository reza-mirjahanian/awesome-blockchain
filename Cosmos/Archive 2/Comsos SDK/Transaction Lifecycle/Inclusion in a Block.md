Consensus, the process through which validator nodes come to agreement on which transactions to accept, happens in **rounds**. Each round begins with a proposer creating a block of the most recent transactions and ends with **validators**, special full-nodes with voting power responsible for consensus, agreeing to accept the block or go with a `nil` block instead. Validator nodes execute the consensus algorithm, such as [CometBFT](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/spec/consensus/), **confirming the transactions** using ABCI requests to the application, in order to come to this agreement.

The first step of consensus is the **block proposal**. One proposer amongst the validators is chosen by the consensus algorithm to create and propose a block - in order for a `Tx` to be included, it must be in this **proposer's mempool**.
