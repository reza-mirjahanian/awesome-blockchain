-   [`AnteHandler`](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/learn/advanced/baseapp#antehandler): This handler is used to handle signature verification, fee payment, and other pre-message execution checks when a transaction is received. It's executed during [`CheckTx/RecheckTx`](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/learn/advanced/baseapp#checktx) and [`FinalizeBlock`](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/learn/advanced/baseapp#finalizeblock).

### . **Core Concept of AnteHandler**

-   **AnteHandler**: The `AnteHandler` is a critical component in the Cosmos SDK's transaction lifecycle, responsible for performing pre-execution checks on transactions. It ensures that transactions are valid before they are processed by the application's message handlers (`Msg` handlers).
-   **Pre-execution Validation**: The `AnteHandler` is invoked immediately after a transaction is decoded and before it is passed to the application for state transitions. This is where checks such as signature verification, fee deduction, and nonce (sequence) validation occur.
-   

**Critical Role**: The `AnteHandler` acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring that only valid and authorized transactions are processed by the blockchain, thus preventing unauthorized state changes and protecting against attacks.
