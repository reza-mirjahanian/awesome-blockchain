Transactions containing one or more valid messages are serialized and confirmed by CometBFT. As you might recall, CometBFT is agnostic to the transaction interpretation and has absolute finality. When a transaction is included in a block, it is confirmed and finalized with no possibility of chain re-organization or cancellation.

The confirmed transaction is relayed to the Cosmos SDK application for interpretation. Each message is routed to the appropriate module via `BaseApp` using `MsgServiceRouter`. `BaseApp` decodes each message contained in the transaction. Each module has its own `MsgService` that processes each received message.
