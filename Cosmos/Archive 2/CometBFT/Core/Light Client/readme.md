Light Client
============

Light clients are an important part of the complete blockchain system for most applications. CometBFT provides unique speed and security properties for light client applications.

See our [light package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cometbft/cometbft/light?tab=doc).

Overview
--------

The objective of the light client protocol is to get a commit for a recent block hash where the commit includes a majority of signatures from the last known validator set. From there, all the application state is verifiable with [merkle proofs](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/blob/v0.38.x/spec/core/encoding.md#iavl-tree).

Properties
----------

-   You get the full collateralized security benefits of CometBFT; no need to wait for confirmations.
-   You get the full speed benefits of CometBFT; transactions commit instantly.
-   You can get the most recent version of the application state non-interactively (without committing anything to the blockchain). For example, this means that you can get the most recent value of a name from the name-registry without worrying about fork censorship attacks, without posting a commit and waiting for confirmations. It's fast, secure, and free!

a "light client" is a type of client that allows users to interact with a blockchain network without needing to download and store the entire blockchain data. This is particularly useful for devices with limited storage capacity or processing power, such as smartphones or embedded systems.

### Key Features of Light Clients in Cosmos:

1.  **Efficiency**: Light clients are designed to be resource-efficient. They only download a small subset of the blockchain data, typically the block headers, which contain essential information like the block hash, timestamp, and Merkle root. This allows them to verify transactions and blocks without needing the full blockchain.

2.  **Security**: Despite not having the full blockchain, light clients maintain a high level of security. They use cryptographic proofs, such as Merkle proofs, to verify that a particular transaction is included in a block. In the Cosmos ecosystem, light clients can also leverage the Tendermint consensus algorithm to ensure the security and integrity of the blockchain data they interact with.

3.  **Interoperability**: Cosmos is designed to be an interoperable network of blockchains, often referred to as the "Internet of Blockchains." Light clients play a crucial role in this ecosystem by enabling cross-chain communication and transactions without the need for full nodes on each blockchain. They can verify and relay transactions between different blockchains within the Cosmos network.

4.  **Use Cases**: Light clients are particularly useful for decentralized applications (dApps), mobile wallets, and other services that require blockchain interaction but cannot afford the overhead of running a full node. They enable users to access blockchain services quickly and efficiently.

5.  **Implementation**: In the Cosmos ecosystem, light clients are implemented using the IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) protocol, which facilitates secure and efficient communication between different blockchains. This allows light clients to function effectively across multiple chains in the Cosmos network.

Overall, light clients are a critical component of the Cosmos ecosystem, enabling broader accessibility and usability of blockchain technology by reducing the resource requirements for participation in the network.
