A fundamental component that makes IBC efficient is its utilization of light client verification. When two chains wish to communicate, there's no need to validate the entire counterpart's state. Instead, they use light clients, which are streamlined versions of a blockchain node, to authenticate cryptographic proofs tied to transactions on the opposite chain. IBC's protocol involves the transmission of packets between chains. While it standardizes how these packets are sent and received, it leaves the specifics of their handling to the individual chains, providing them a degree of autonomy and flexibility.
