### Vision of Cosmos

*   **Three-Tiered Solution:** Addresses key problems in blockchains, setting Cosmos apart.

    *   **Scalability:**
        *   **Problem Addressed:** Limitations in scalability, cost, security, and user experience in blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum hindering mass adoption.
        *   **Cosmos Approach:** Vertical and Horizontal Scalability.
        *   ***Vertical Scalability:***
            *   Increasing transactions per second (TPS) within a single blockchain.
            *   Examples: Solana, Rollups, Tendermint.
            *   **Tendermint:** Proof-of-Stake consensus engine, based on 70s research on Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT).
        *   ***Horizontal Scalability:***
            *   Achieved through Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC).
            *   **Application Specific Blockchains:** Core Paradigm in Cosmos.
                *   Analogy: Single Smart Contract on an Entire Blockchain vs. DApps on shared state VMs like Ethereum.
                *   **Benefits of Application Specific Blockchains:**
                    *   Dedicated resources (processing power, storage, transaction block space).
                    *   Eliminates competition for block space among multiple applications, reducing transaction costs.
                    *   Customization and Sovereignty (detailed below).
                *   **Addressing Feasibility Concerns:** Tendermint, Cosmos SDK, and IBC protocols make application-specific blockchains practical.
        *   **Horizontal Scalability via IBC:**
            *   Problem: Application-specific blockchains are isolated.
            *   Solution: IBC for asynchronous communication between blockchains.
            *   Analogy to TCP/IP: Packets of information relayed between blockchains.
            *   Relayers: Entities that transport IBC packets between blockchains.
            *   Enables deploying multiple instances of the same application across different blockchains, increasing total TPS while maintaining synchronicity through IBC.

    *   **Sovereignty:**
        *   **Key Benefit of Application Specific Blockchains:** Customization.
        *   **Customization:** Blockchains are tailored to the specific needs of the application.
        *   **Contrast with Shared State VMs (e.g., Ethereum):** Features and parameters are one-size-fits-all, difficult to change for specific DApp needs.
        *   **FUBU (For Us By Us) Principle:** Application developers control all aspects of their blockchain.
        *   **Reduces Conflict:** Avoids disagreements about blockchain direction seen in shared state VMs (e.g., Ethereum Classic split).
        *   **Simplicity and Integrity:**  Focus on a single application purpose simplifies governance and maintains blockchain integrity.

    *   **Interoperability:**        *   **Enables Separation of Concerns:** Each blockchain can focus on a specific application or purpose.
        *   **Laser Focus on Product:**  Facilitates building successful products by concentrating on specific user needs.
        *   **Lean Purpose:** Promotes efficient and focused application development.
        *   **Interoperability as a Foundational Element:**  Underpins both scalability and sovereignty.

            *   Application executes transactions and manages state.
            *   ABCI facilitates communication for block proposals, transaction validation (`CheckTx`), block delivery, and state updates.
    *   **2/3 Majority Question (Q&A):**
        *   **2/3 vs. 50%:** Why 2/3 majority is crucial for BFT consensus.
        *   **Honest Majority Thresholds:**
            *   **2/3 Honest:** Guarantees no censorship.
            *   **1/3 Honest:** Censorship becomes possible.
        *   **Censorship Scenario:** 1/3+1 bad actors can prevent transaction gossip, hindering censorship-resistant properties.
        *   **Importance for Slashing:** Prevents malicious actors with 1/3 control from suppressing evidence of their misbehavior.
        *   **Blockchain Halt:** Requires 2/3+1 bad actors to halt or fork the blockchain.
        *   **Algorithm Details:**  Mathematical proofs in Tendermint and pBFT algorithms explain the 2/3 requirement.

*   **Cosmos SDK:**
    *   **Analogy:** "Ruby on Rails for Blockchains."
    *   ***Software Development Kit (SDK) for Application Specific Blockchains:***

                    *   Optimized for efficiency: Skips block processing steps while maintaining cryptographic security.
                    *   IBC Light Clients: Each blockchain runs a light client of the *other* connected blockchain *within* its own state machine.
                    *   Client Updates: Blockchains periodically exchange client updates to keep light clients synchronized (minimum every two weeks to avoid divergence).
                    *   Enables validation of IBC packets by verifying cryptographic proofs derived from the other blockchain's light client state.
                *   ***Solo Machine Clients:***  Alternative authentication method (lower trust).
                    *   Trust relies on a single entity's signature instead of blockchain consensus.
                    *   Use Case Example: WordPress interacting with Cosmos ecosystem. WordPress can create IBC packets signed by its operator.
                    *   Lower security but may be suitable for specific use cases. e.g., Centralized Exchanges wanting to use IBC.
            *   ***Ordering Layer:*** (Shipping Order Management)
                *   Ensures packets are processed in the correct order.                *   Handles scenarios where packets are split or order-dependent actions are required.
                *   Timeout Mechanisms: Addresses packet loss and ensures operations eventually complete or time out.
                *   Similar to TCP/IP in terms of ordering and reliability.
        *   **IBC Handshake:** Initial connection setup where blockchains exchange information about their light clients and genesis state.

            *   Base currency for interchain transactions and ecosystem value.
        *   ***Public Goods Funding:***
            *   Adam has funded development of essential Cosmos infrastructure (Tendermint, Cosmos SDK, IBC, etc.).
            *   Coordination and funding mechanism for public goods within the ecosystem.
    *   **Solo Machine Client Question (Q&A):**
        *   **Solo Machine as Trusted Third Party:**  Solo machine (e.g., WordPress instance) operator acts as a trusted entity.
        *   **User Trust Decision:** Users decide whether to trust tokens originating from a solo machine based on their trust in the operator.
        *   **Example: Billy Tokens:** WordPress instance creates "Billy" tokens via solo machine IBC packets. These tokens exist on the Hub but their value is determined by user trust.
        *   **Blockchain Protocol Functionality:** Cosmos Hub protocol technically accepts and processes solo machine IBC packets if configured to do so.
