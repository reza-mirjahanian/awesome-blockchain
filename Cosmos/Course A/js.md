## **Interchain JavaScript Stack**
### **Overview**
- A suite of tools to simplify blockchain UI/UX development in the Cosmos ecosystem.
- Aims to lower the barrier for developers, especially front-end engineers, to build applications.

---

### **Components**
1. **Telescope**:
   - Reads blockchain protocols like a "printing press" to generate client SDKs.
   - Allows front-end developers to work seamlessly with backend blockchain systems.

2. **Ts Codegen**:
   - Similar to Telescope but specifically for CosmWasm smart contracts.

3. **ChainRegistry**:
   - Provides essential blockchain data (logos, token information, denominations, asset lists).

4. **Cosmos Kit (soon to become Interchain Kit)**:
   - A wallet adapter for Cosmos wallets (e.g., Keplr, Leap, Ledger).
   - Simplifies wallet integration with one interface.

5. **Create Cosmos App**:
   - A boilerplate starter kit for Cosmos applications.
   - Pre-packaged with necessary tools like Telescope, Cosm JS, Cosmos Kit, and ChainRegistry.

6. **Starship**:
   - A CI/CD testing environment for blockchain lifecycles.
   - Enables writing JavaScript for end-to-end tests.

7. **Cosm JS (evolving into Interchain JS)**:
   - A JavaScript library for interacting with Cosmos blockchains.
   - Supports signing, encoding, and account derivations.
   - Built for scalability and extension.

8. **Interchain UI**:
   - A UI kit for building interfaces in the Cosmos ecosystem.

## **User-Centric Design**
### **Data-Driven Approach**
- **Key Insight**: According to a study by S16 Research Ventures (April 2023), users prioritize **UI/UX** over:
  - Performance
  - Tokenomics
  - Airdrops
  - Yield
  - Security
- **Cosmology's Alignment**: Focus on UI/UX tooling matches user demands.

---

## **Why JavaScript?**
- **Importance**:
  - Most UI/front-end development uses JavaScript.
  - JavaScript is the "language of the people."
- **Developer Stats**:
  - ~20–25 million JavaScript developers globally.
  - Only ~4 million developers know Rust or Go.
- **Impact**:
  - Simplifies front-end development by abstracting complex backend languages (Rust, Go).
  - Expands access to blockchain development for JavaScript and CSS developers.

## **Complexity in Blockchain Development**
### **Challenges**:
- **Pre-Cosmology:**
  - Developers required CTO-level skills to manage:
    - Rust-based smart contracts.
    - Go Cosmos SDK blockchain code.
    - JavaScript npm module creation and publishing.
  - Each project had inconsistent client SDKs, increasing complexity.
  - Communication bottlenecks due to the "N² communication problem" (as outlined in *The Mythical Man-Month*).

### **Solution**:
- **Post-Cosmology:**
  - Telescope automates SDK generation.
  - Eliminates the need for specialized engineers to bridge backend and frontend.
  - Unified standards across chains simplify scaling and interoperability.

## **Interchain JS: The New Universal Signing Client**
### **Key Features**:
1. **Universal Network Adapters**:
   - Supports multiple blockchain networks.
   - Encoders like **Amino** and **Protobuf** are built-in.
   - Future support for **EIP-712**.
   - Single JavaScript library with pluggable adapters.

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - **Tree Shaking**:
     - Packages only the required code into applications.
     - Reduces bundle size for faster load times.
   - **Web2 Approach**:
     - Focus on fast loading times (~100–200ms) to improve user retention.

3. **Test-Driven Development**:
   - Built with end-to-end testing.
   - Beta version available on GitHub and NPM.

## **Cosmos Kit: Universal Wallet Adapter**
- **Purpose**:
  - Simplifies wallet integration for front-end developers.
  - Supports wallets like Keplr, Ledger, and Leap.
- **Updates**:
  - Rebuilt from the ground up to integrate with Interchain JS.
  - Smaller bundle size and improved testing.
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Support for EIP-712 to integrate Ethereum and Solana wallets (e.g., Metamask).

---

## **Ecosystem Integration**
- **Vue and React Support**:
  - Official support for both frameworks.
- **Telescope Updates**:
  - Improved tree shaking and code generation for Stargate client helpers.
- **Create Cosmos App**:
  - Adds a **Chain Admin Dashboard** with features like:
    - Staking
    - Governance
    - Asset lists
    - Faucet for testnet tokens
    - Contract admin tools
  - Integrated with **Spawn CLI** for spinning up new chains.

---

## **Expanding Beyond Cosmos**
- **Vision**:
  - Build bridges to other blockchain ecosystems.
  - Universal tools to connect with Ethereum, Solana, and others.
- **Interchain JS as a Bridge**:
  - Allows seamless integration with external ecosystems.
  - Enables cross-ecosystem dApp development.

---

## **Philosophy**
- **Solve People Problems**:
  - Focus on what users and developers truly need.
- **Rediscover the Joy of Programming**:
  - Move from "software construction" to "software engineering"
  - Simplify development to enable creativity and artistic coding.
