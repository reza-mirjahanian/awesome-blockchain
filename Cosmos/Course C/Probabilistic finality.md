Probabilistic finality

**Probabilistic finality** describes the finality of a transaction dependent on how probable reverting a block is, i.e. the probability of removing a transaction. The more blocks that come after the block containing a specific transaction, the less probable it is that a transaction may be reverted, as *longest* or *heaviest chain rules* apply in the case of forks.

Absolute finality

**Absolute finality** is a trait of protocols based on Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Finality comes as soon as a transaction and block are verified. There are no scenarios in which a transaction can be revoked after it has been finalized.
