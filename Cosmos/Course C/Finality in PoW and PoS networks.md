Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks can have absolute finality because the total staked amount is known at all times. It takes a *public* transaction to stake, and another to unstake. If some majority of the stakers agree on a block, then the block can be considered "final" because there is no process that could overturn the consensus.

This is different from PoW networks, where the total hashing capacity is unknown; it can only be estimated by a combination of the puzzle's difficulty and the speed at which new blocks are issued. Hashing capacity can be added or removed simply by turning machines on or off. When hashing capacity is removed too abruptly it results in a drop in the network transaction throughput, as blocks suddenly fail to be issued around the target interval.
