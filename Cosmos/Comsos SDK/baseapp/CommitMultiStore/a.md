What is the CommitMultiStore?
-----------------------------

The `CommitMultiStore` is a key component in the Cosmos SDK that manages multiple stores and ensures that state changes are committed atomically. It's essentially a collection of key-value stores that can be used to store and retrieve data in a blockchain application.

Why Use the CommitMultiStore?
-----------------------------

1.  **Atomic Commits**: Ensures that all state changes are committed together or not at all.
2.  **Modularity**: Allows you to manage multiple stores for different modules.
3.  **Consistency**: Maintains the integrity of your blockchain state.
