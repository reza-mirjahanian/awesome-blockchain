Data Management
---------------

1.  **State Storage**: The state of the blockchain, including account balances, smart contract states, and transaction histories, is stored in the database. Each transaction modifies the state, and these changes are recorded in the DB.
2.  **Event and Transaction Logging**: The Cosmos SDK allows for the collection of transaction and event data, which can be stored in the database for later querying and analysis. For instance, the `cosmostxcollector` package can collect transactions and events from Cosmos blockchains and save them in a PostgreSQL database, enabling efficient data retrieval and analysis.
3.  **Querying Data**: Developers can implement various querying mechanisms to retrieve data from the database. This can include fetching account balances, transaction histories, or specific events triggered by smart contracts.
