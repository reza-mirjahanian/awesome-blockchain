-   Database: The `db` is used by the `CommitMultiStore` to handle data persistence.


Data Management
---------------

1.  **State Storage**: The state of the blockchain, including account balances, smart contract states, and transaction histories, is stored in the database. Each transaction modifies the state, and these changes are recorded in the DB.
2.  **Event and Transaction Logging**: The Cosmos SDK allows for the collection of transaction and event data, which can be stored in the database for later querying and analysis. For instance, the `cosmostxcollector` package can collect transactions and events from Cosmos blockchains and save them in a PostgreSQL database, enabling efficient data retrieval and analysis.
3.  **Querying Data**: Developers can implement various querying mechanisms to retrieve data from the database. This can include fetching account balances, transaction histories, or specific events triggered by smart contracts.

--------------------------

### 1. **Storage in Cosmos SDK:**

-   **Merkle Store**: The primary storage mechanism in Cosmos SDK is the **IAVL+ Tree** (Immutable AVL Tree), which is a self-balancing binary search tree. It's used because of its efficiency in providing proofs for data existence and non-existence, which is crucial for light clients and interoperability features in Cosmos.

-   **State Storage**: The state of the blockchain (which includes account balances, staking information, governance proposals, etc.) is stored in this Merkle tree. Each module in a Cosmos SDK application can define its own key-value store, which is then Merkle-ized to ensure all changes can be tracked and proven.

### 2. **Database Backend:**

-   **LevelDB**: By default, Cosmos SDK uses LevelDB, a fast key-value storage library written by Google that provides an ordered mapping from string keys to string values. LevelDB supports batch operations, forward and backward iteration, and compression, which makes it suitable for blockchain data.

-   **Alternative Backends**: While LevelDB is the default, the Cosmos SDK is designed to be database-agnostic to some extent. This means other databases can be used if they implement the necessary interfaces. For instance:

    -   **BadgerDB**: Sometimes used as an alternative due to its high performance in write-intensive applications. It's optimized for SSDs and provides better performance in some scenarios compared to LevelDB.

    -   **RocksDB**: Another option, though less commonly mentioned in direct association with current Cosmos SDK projects, it's similar to LevelDB but offers more features and sometimes better performance.

### 3. **How Data is Managed:**

-   **Commit**: At the end of each block, the state changes are committed. This involves updating the IAVL+ tree, where the root hash changes if any part of the state tree has been altered. This root hash is part of the block header, ensuring the integrity of the state.

-   **Modules and Stores**: Each module in the Cosmos SDK (like `auth`, `bank`, `staking`, etc.) can define multiple stores. These stores can be in-memory, persistent, or even transient (not saved between application restarts).

-   **KVStore Interface**: The Cosmos SDK provides a KVStore interface that abstracts the underlying database. This allows developers to write code without worrying too much about the backend storage solution; they just interact with this interface.

### 4. **Transaction Processing:**

-   **AnteHandler**: During transaction processing, before a transaction is executed, the `AnteHandler` performs initial checks and operations (like fee deduction). Here, preliminary state changes might be written to an in-memory store or directly to the DB in a batched manner.

-   **Post-Execution**: After transaction execution, if successful, these changes are then committed permanently to the database.

### 5. **Backup and Pruning:**

-   **Pruning**: Over time, blockchain data can grow immensely. Cosmos SDK includes mechanisms for pruning old data that's no longer necessary for state validation or operation, which helps in managing the database size.

-   **Snapshots**: For quick syncing of new nodes, snapshots of the state at certain heights can be taken and shared, reducing the time needed to sync from genesis.
