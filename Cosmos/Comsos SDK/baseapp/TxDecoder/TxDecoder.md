-   [`TxDecoder`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types#TxDecoder): It is used to decode raw transaction bytes relayed by the underlying CometBFT engine.


### **Core Concepts of TxDecoder**

-   **TxDecoder**: The `TxDecoder` is responsible for interpreting and decoding raw transaction bytes into a structured format (`sdk.Tx`) that the Cosmos SDK can process. It's an essential component in the transaction processing pipeline, converting raw binary data into a form that the application logic can manipulate.
-   **CometBFT Engine**: Formerly known as Tendermint, CometBFT is the consensus engine that handles networking, consensus, and the ordering of transactions in the Cosmos SDK. Raw transactions are broadcast to nodes, and the `TxDecoder` decodes these transactions so they can be processed and validated.

### 2\. **Transaction Encoding and Decoding**

-   **Protobuf Serialization**: Transactions in the Cosmos SDK are serialized into bytes using Protocol Buffers (Protobuf). The `TxDecoder` reverses this process by deserializing the bytes back into a `Tx` object.
