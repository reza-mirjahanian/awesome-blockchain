## Node Client

The Daemon, orÂ [Full-Node Client](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/learn/advanced/node), is the core process of a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain. Participants in the network run this process to initialize their state-machine, connect with other full-nodes, and update their state-machine as new blocks come in.
