## Why the Cosmos SDK
-   It allows you to plug and play and customize your consensus layer. As above you can use **Rollkit** and **Celestia** as your consensus and data availability layer. This offers a lot of flexibility and customisation.
-   Previously the default consensus engine available within the Cosmos SDK is [CometBFT](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft). CometBFT is the most (and only) mature BFT consensus engine in existence. It is widely used across the industry and is considered the gold standard consensus engine for building Proof-of-Stake systems.
-   The Cosmos SDK is open-source and designed to make it easy to build blockchains out of composable [modules](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/build/modules). As the ecosystem of open-source Cosmos SDK modules grows, it will become increasingly easier to build complex decentralized platforms with it.
-   The Cosmos SDK is inspired by capabilities-based security, and informed by years of wrestling with blockchain state-machines. This makes the Cosmos SDK a very secure environment to build blockchains.
-   Most importantly, the Cosmos SDK has already been used to build many application-specific blockchains that are already in production. Among others, we can cite [Cosmos Hub](https://hub.cosmos.network/), [IRIS Hub](https://irisnet.org/), [Binance Chain](https://docs.binance.org/), [Terra](https://terra.money/) or [Kava](https://www.kava.io/). [Many more](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem) are building on the Cosmos SDK.
