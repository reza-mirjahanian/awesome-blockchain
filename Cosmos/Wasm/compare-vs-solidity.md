### CosmWasm smart contracts VS Solidity contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. 


CosmWasm offers a distinct approach to smart contracts compared to Solidity contracts used on Ethereum. It prioritizes security and resource efficiency, learning from the experiences and vulnerabilities of its predecessor. CosmWasm employs a three-step contract deployment process:

-   **Upload Code:**  This step involves uploading optimized Wasm code without any associated state or contract address. This can be seen as analogous to deploying a standard ERC20 contract.
-   **Instantiate Contract:**  This phase creates a new contract address by instantiating a code reference with initial state. For instance, setting the token name, maximum issuance, etc., for an ERC20 token.
-   **Execute Contract:**  This allows for various calls to the instantiated contract, all of which are unprivileged and based on the contract's design. Examples include sending ERC20 tokens or granting approval to another contract.

Both instantiation and execution require gas, similar to Ethereum. While sending tokens to a contract is possible, it does not trigger any code execution by design. This choice aims to mitigate potential attack vectors.

**Key Differences and Security Enhancements:**

-   **Reentrancy Prevention:**  CosmWasm prevents reentrancy attacks by design. Instead of direct contract calls, it allows contracts to return lists of messages to be executed in the same transaction, ensuring atomic composition and enhanced security.
-   **Resource Limits:**  CosmWasm employs strict resource limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks. It enforces limitations on memory usage, CPU usage, and disk usage, ensuring that smart contracts have minimal impact on the blockchain's performance.
-   **Lessons from Ethereum Vulnerabilities:**  CosmWasm addresses many of the known Ethereum attack vectors. It incorporates features like overflow checks, explicit storage management, and type-safe JSON parsing to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

**Comparison with Solidity Security Concerns:**

-   **Reentrancy:**  CosmWasm's approach to message execution eliminates reentrancy vulnerabilities.
-   **Arithmetic Overflow:**  Rust's built-in overflow checks ensure that arithmetic operations are safe and do not lead to unexpected behavior.
-   **Unexpected Ether:**  CosmWasm contracts do not depend on their balance for execution, preventing vulnerabilities related to unexpected token transfers.
-   **Delegate Call:**  CosmWasm does not have a similar mechanism, promoting modularity and security.
-   **Default Visibilities:**  CosmWasm requires developers to explicitly define entry points, reducing the risk of accidental exposure of functions.
-   **Entropy Illusion:**  CosmWasm plans to provide a secure random beacon for randomness generation, mitigating issues with block timestamp manipulation.
-   **External Contract Referencing:**  CosmWasm encourages linking all necessary code into a single Wasm blob, reducing the need for external contract references and ensuring code verification.
-   **Unchecked CALL Return Values:**  CosmWasm handles message execution through a router, ensuring that all messages in a transaction are executed successfully.
-   **Race Conditions/Front Running:**  While race conditions are a general problem in blockchains, CosmWasm relies on the Tendermint consensus mechanism, which offers better timestamp guarantees.
-   **Denial of Service:**  CosmWasm's robust resource limits and efficient Wasm runtime minimize the risk of denial-of-service attacks.
-   **Block Timestamp Manipulation:**  Tendermint's BFT timestamps make it difficult to manipulate block timestamps.
-   **Constructors with Care:**  CosmWasm's compiler enforces strict naming conventions, eliminating potential backdoors.
-   **Uninitialised Storage Pointers:**  Rust prevents the use of uninitialized variables, enhancing code safety.
-   **Floating Points and Precision:**  CosmWasm supports various Rust libraries for accurate decimal calculations, addressing potential rounding errors.
-   **Tx.Origin Authentication:**  CosmWasm exposes only the contract or user directly calling the contract, eliminating ambiguity in authentication.
