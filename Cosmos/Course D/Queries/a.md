A query is a request for information, made by end-users of an application through an interface, and processed by a full node. Available information includes:

-   Information about the network.
-   Information about the application itself.
-   Information about the application state.

Queries do not require consensus to be processed as they do not trigger state transitions. Therefore queries can be handled entirely independently by a full node.
