ABCI itself includes methods such as `DeliverTx`, which delivers a transaction. The interpretation of the transaction is an application-level responsibility. Since a typical application supports more than one type of transaction, interpretation implies the need for a service router that will send the transaction to different interpreters based on the transaction type. `BaseApp` includes a service router implementation.

`BaseApp` also provides a state machine implementation. The implementation of a state machine is an application-level concern because the CometBFT consensus is application-agnostic. The Cosmos SDK state machine implementation contains an overall state that is subdivided into various substates. Subdivisions include module states, persistent states, and transient states. These are all implemented in `BaseApp`.
