### Introduction to Appchains

Appchains are custom blockchains built using the Cosmos SDK. They allow developers to tailor the functionality and governance of their blockchain to meet specific needs. Whether you're building a decentralized finance platform, a supply chain management solution, or any other blockchain application, appchains provide the flexibility and scalability required.


Typically, the architecture of full-fledged appchains is composed of five layers:

1. **Network layer.** This layer manages the peer-to-peer network functionalities. It enables nodes within the blockchain to communicate, exchange data, and participate in transaction validation processes.

2. **Application layer.** This layer hosts applications that run on the blockchain. It offers interfaces that developers can utilize to build, deploy, and oversee the operations of decentralized applications DApps]

3. **Data layer.** The data layer is responsible for organizing and storing blockchain information. This includes maintaining the blockchain's state, recording transaction details, and handling smart contract data.

4. **Consensus layer.** This layer implements the [consensus algorithm] of the appchain. It can incorporate various consensus algorithms, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).

5. **Smart contract layer.** This layer facilitates the automation, verification, and enforcement of smart contracts.


## Appchains vs. Layer 1 Blockchains

### Architecture

The architecture of appchains is adaptable and can be aligned with different blockchain layers, allowing them to either be built on top of existing networks or operate independently. In contrast, layer 1 blockchains feature a uniform structure with a set of defined rules that network participants must follow, limiting their ability to adjust to the specific needs of individual DApps.

### Consensus algorithm

Appchains can implement consensus mechanisms that are most suitable for their particular use case, which can vary depending on the underlying layer they are built upon or if they operate autonomously. Conversely, layer 1 blockchains are typically bound to their inherent consensus models, such as PoW or PoS, which may not be as adaptable to specific applications but provide a stable and uniform method of reaching consensus.

### Scalability

Appchains are designed to prioritize scalability within the context of individual applications, which can result in high transaction throughput and low latency. In contrast, layer 1 blockchains often face scalability issues as they accommodate a wide variety of applications.

## Appchains vs. Sidechains

Although both appchains and sidechains communicate with the main chain, sidechains are designed to perform a variety of tasks. So, unlike appchains, sidechains serve multiple purposes and are not tailored to a specific application.


## Examples of Appchains

### Polkadot parachains

[Polkadot](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-polkadot-dot)'s parachains are individual blockchains that run in parallel within the Polkadot ecosystem. They are connected to Polkadot's Relay Chain, benefitting from its security. Parachains are identical to appchains as they can have their own tokenomics, governance models, and functionality, making them tailored to the specific needs of individual applications.

### Avalanche subnets

[Avalanche](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-avalanche-avax) subnets represent separate blockchains created within the Avalanche network. They enable the development of application-specific blockchains, with each subnet supported by its unique set of validators that agree on the state of a set of blockchains.

### Cosmos zones

[Cosmos](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-cosmos-atom) zones function as independent blockchains linked to the Cosmos Hub, serving as the equivalent of appchains in the Cosmos ecosystem. They use the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to transfer data across the network.


## What is An Example of an Appchain?

[dYdX Chain](https://dydx.exchange/blog/dydx-chain)  is a prime example of an Appchain tailored for  [decentralized perpetual trading](https://www.datawallet.com/crypto/best-decentralized-perpetuals-exchanges)  in the DeFi space. This standalone, open-source blockchain, built on the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint's Proof-of-Stake consensus, is specifically designed for the dYdX protocol's needs. It heralds the protocol's shift towards full decentralization, utilizing Cosmos for improved scalability and flexibility.

[dYdX](https://www.datawallet.com/crypto/what-is-dydx)  introduces a decentralized, off-chain orderbook and matching engine capable of managing a volume far beyond what traditional blockchains can handle. This leap forward enhances the protocol's efficiency and performance, underlining dYdX's dedication to decentralization and user empowerment, marking a significant evolution in DeFi trading platforms.


### Celestia 
Celestia builds the first modular blockchain network with Cosmos SDK. Celestia introduces a new scaling primitive, data availability sampling, to solve the data availability problem. Rollups face the problems of insufficient throughput or weak security with existing data availability solutions. They needed to build a scalable data availability layer for rollups while making it accessible and easy for them to verify.


Celestia provides a data availability layer that scales with the number of users while enabling rollups to verify data availability with just a light node. Opting to use the interchain stack, including CometBFT and IBC, provided Celestia with a state machine, consensus network, and interoperability out-of-the-box.

### Osmosis 
Osmosis you can swap, earn and build on the largest interchain decentralized exchange
A fundamental infrastructure for the interchain, Osmosis is a Cosmos SDK-based automated market maker, enabling cross chain transactions via IBC.
The Osmosis team wanted to bring the first interchain decentralized exchange to market, unlocking cross-chain swaps and enabling liquidity between different interchain economies.
Osmosis subscribes to the interchain's appchain thesis: with full control, you can develop a tailored solution to fit your projects' needs without having to inherit external logic.


###  Sei

[Sei](https://www.sei.io/) is an example of the blockchain that is built on the Cosmos SDK. It operates as a layer-1 blockchain and just like most other Appchains, gives a high degree of flexibility and freedom to its developers. Sei is industry-specific with the main focus on the trading, which means that it has the ability to provide an “unfair advantage” to the exchanges.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before you can create your appchain, you need to set up your development environment. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Install Go**: Cosmos SDK is written in Go, so installing Go is the first step.


2. **Install Cosmos SDK**: Clone the Cosmos SDK repository and install it.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk
    cd cosmos-sdk
    make install
