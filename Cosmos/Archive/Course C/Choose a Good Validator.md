# How to Choose a Good Validator on Cosmos


## Key Variables for Choosing a Validator
1. Commission
2. Validator's self-stake
3. Downtime or risk of slashing
4. Potential airdrops
5. Voting power
6. Community engagement

## Role of Validators
- Maintain the network
- Participate in consensus
- Process and create new blocks
- Get rewarded in ATOM

## Detailed Breakdown of Variables

### 1. Commission
- **Definition**: Percentage validators take from staking rewards
- **Example**: 
  - Base staking reward: 14.87% APR
  - Commission: 5%
  - Actual reward: 14.87% * 0.95 = 14.136% APR
- **Warning**: Some validators (like Kraken) have 100% commission

### 2. Validator's Self-Stake
- **Importance**: Shows validator's investment in their own product
- **Example**: Stake.fish has bonded 115,000 ATOM (1% of total value)

### 3. Downtime and Slash Risk
- **Downtime**: Periods when validator is not processing blocks
- **Slashing**: Punishment for downtime or misconduct
  - 0.01% slash for <5% block signs in 10,000 blocks
  - 5% slash for double signing

### 4. Airdrops
- Some validators offer additional airdrops
- Example: King Nodes gives Craft Economy airdrop

### 5. Voting Power
- Top 10 validators control 40% of voting rights
- **Example**: Stake.fish has 6.16% voting power
- Users can override validator's vote

### 6. Community Engagement
- Look for validators with strong social presence
- Engage with validators on platforms like Telegram or Twitter

## Considerations for Voting
- Low voter turnout (e.g., 45%)
- Some major validators don't participate in voting
- Users can change their validator's vote

## Summary of Selection Criteria
1. Commission: Around 5% (avoid 0% or 100%)
2. Self-stake: Higher is better
3. Downtime: Minimal
4. Airdrops: Bonus feature
5. Voting power: Be aware, but you can still vote independently
6. Community engagement: Look for responsive and transparent validators
