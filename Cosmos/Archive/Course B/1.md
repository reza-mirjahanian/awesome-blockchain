# Cosmos SDK and Tendermint: A Comprehensive Overview


## What is the Cosmos SDK?

### Definition
- Collection of modules to build blockchain applications
- Fully customizable

### Features Out of the Box
- Delegated proof of stake system
- Governance system
- Inflation
- Account-based model (similar to Ethereum)

### Limitations
- Described as "limitless"
- Can build practically anything

### Virtual Machine Support
- Solidity
- CosmWasm (Rust and TypeScript)
- Agoric (JavaScript)

## Tendermint

### Definition
- Consensus and networking layer

### Features
- Instant finality
- Low block times
- Large validator sets (100-150 validators, but can go higher)

### History
- Originally designed by Jae Kwon, later by Ethan Buchman
- Designed as a consensus library

### Components
1. Tendermint Core (consensus layer)
2. Application layer (e.g., Cosmos SDK)
3. ABCI (Application Blockchain Interface)

## Cosmos SDK Architecture

### Base App
- Foundation of the Cosmos SDK
- Handles:
  1. Message routing
  2. Query handling
  3. Storage management

### Storage
- Uses a Merkle tree called IVL

## Development with Cosmos SDK

### Languages
- Golang (for native Cosmos SDK modules)
- Rust (via CosmWasm)

### Clients
- cosm.js (JavaScript toolkit)
- Cosmos.js (work from Cosmology and Dan)
- Go client package
- Cosmos Rust

### Underlying Technologies
- JSON RPC
- gRPC
- Protobuf encoding

## Features of Cosmos SDK

1. Decentralized starts
2. Painless upgrades (for validators, more challenging for developers)

## Known Applications in Cosmos Ecosystem
- Akash
- Celestia
- Cosmos Hub
- Terra
- Juno
- Injective
- Crypto.com
- Oasis

## Interchain Academy
- Educational program for newcomers to the Cosmos ecosystem
- Covers topics like:
  - Writing a Cosmos SDK chain
  - Deploying a chain
  - Performing upgrades

## Q&A Session

### Organizations in Cosmos Ecosystem
- Originated from All in Bits / Tendermint
- Now includes:
  - Interchain GmbH
  - Strange Love
  - Informal
  - Inclusion

### Terra Update
- Reestablishing IBC connection with Osmosis and Juno
- Notion taking on development work

### ATOM 2.0
- Major announcement scheduled for September 28th in Colombia
- Revamp of token economics

### Cosmos SDK vs Substrate
- Cosmos SDK: Bottom-up approach, verbose but transparent
- Substrate: Top-down approach, abstracted via Rust macros

### Upcoming Features in Cosmos SDK
1. ABCI 1.0 (previously ABCI++)
   - Prepare proposal and process proposal
   - App-side mempool
2. Store package revamp
3. Auto-generating CLI


### Key Points:

1. **Decentralization and Collaboration**:
    - Despite the aim to decentralize core development, a central starting point and a strong vision have kept the community cohesive.
    - Different organizations within the Cosmos ecosystem, such as Strangelove, Interchain Gamba, and others, work on specific components like IBC, Tendermint, and the Cosmos SDK.
    - The community operates like a "big family," maintaining close collaboration and communication, often through shared communication platforms like Slack.

2. **Projects and Contributions**:
    - **Strangelove**: Focuses on IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) development.
    - **Interchain Gamba**: Works on the SDK and IBC, alongside the Cosmos Hub.
    - **Other Contributions**: Various teams and individuals contribute to multiple projects within the ecosystem, often bouncing ideas off each other.

3. **Cosmos Ecosystem Vision**:
    - A strong, unified vision and mission have driven the community since the early days (2014-2017).
    - This shared vision has been crucial in keeping the community intact and motivated.

4. **Terra and IBC Connections**:
    - Efforts are ongoing to reestablish IBC connections between Terra, Osmosis, and Juno.
    - There have been quiet periods, but work continues, particularly on enabling governance proposals to restore these connections.

5. **Adam 2.0 Announcement**:
    - An upcoming announcement in Colombia on September 28 will detail the next evolution of the Adam token, addressing new economic models and the challenges faced since the initial launch.
    - The announcement is expected to include new launch partners and significant updates to the ecosystem.

6. **Technical Comparisons and Enhancements**:
    - Comparison between Cosmos SDK and Substrate:
        - **Cosmos SDK**: Bottom-up approach, verbose but transparent coding.
        - **Substrate**: Top-down approach, relies on Rust macros which abstract the complexity.
    - Future Enhancements:
        - **ABC 1.0**: Introduction of an app-side mempool allowing applications to define block space construction.
        - **Store Package Revamp**: Expected to improve performance significantly.
        - **Auto-Generated CLI**: Aimed at reducing boilerplate code, improving developer experience.

### Summary:
The Cosmos ecosystem is characterized by a tightly-knit, collaborative community that originated from a central vision. Various organizations contribute to different aspects of the ecosystem, maintaining close ties and communication. Key ongoing projects include enhancing IBC connections and significant updates to the Cosmos Hub and SDK. An important upcoming announcement will reveal the next phase for the Adam token and associated economic models. Technical advancements focus on improving performance and developer experience through new features like app-side mempools and auto-generated CLIs. The commitment to a shared vision and mission continues to drive the ecosystem's growth and innovation.
