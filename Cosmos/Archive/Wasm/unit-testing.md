## Unit Testing

The guide encourages using unit testing to thoroughly test individual components of your contract. However, it doesn't provide specific details on unit testing methods or tools. Instead, it directs readers to a separate guide on unit testing, implying that it is a separate subject.

## Integration Testing with  `cw-multi-test`

The  `cw-multi-test`  package, provided by the  `cw-plus`  repository, offers a powerful tool for integration testing, enabling developers to test complex interactions between smart contracts without the need for real-world deployment.

**Key Concepts of `cw-multi-test`:**

-   **`App`:**  The  `App`  object simulates a blockchain environment, maintaining block height, time, and allowing updates to simulate block progression.
-   **Mocking Contracts:**  `cw-multi-test`  provides a  `ContractWrapper`  to wrap your contract's logical components (instantiate, execute, query, reply) and deploy them to a mocked network.
-   **Storing and Instantiating Contracts:**  Before instantiating a contract, the contract code must be stored within the  `cw-multi-test`  environment, enabling instantiation using the associated code ID.
-   **Mocking Third-Party Contracts:**  To test interactions with third-party services, you can create thin mocks that implement the necessary functionality, allowing you to simulate interactions with services like TerraSwap or Anchor.

**Key Steps for Integration Testing:**

1.  **Mock Contracts:**  Create mocks for all contracts involved in your test, including your own contracts and any third-party services.
2.  **Store Code:**  Store the code of your mocked contracts within the  `cw-multi-test`  environment.
3.  **Instantiate Contracts:**  Instantiate your mocked contracts using the stored code IDs.
4.  **Execute and Query:**  Use the  `App`  object to execute actions and query the state of your mocked contracts.
