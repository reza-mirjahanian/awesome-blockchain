Here's a detailed breakdown of the text, formatted for better readability:

# Blockchain Node Types

## Full Node

**Definition**: A node that downloads and processes the entire blockchain.

**Characteristics**:
- Downloads every single block
- Executes every single transaction
- Tracks the entire state of the application

**Advantages**:
- Complete access to the state
- No need to trust third parties

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires storing a humongous amount of state
- *Example*: Cosmos blockchain state is many gigabytes

## Light Client

**Definition**: A more efficient way of tracking a blockchain.

**Characteristics**:
- Only downloads the headers of a blockchain
- Has access to root hashes (app hashes)
- Does not have access to the entire state

**Advantages**:
- Requires much less storage space
- Can still verify state inclusion with proofs

**Process for verifying state**:
1. Light client requests proof from a full node
2. Full node provides:
   - The key and value of the state
   - A proof of inclusion
3. Light client can verify the proof against its root hash

# Cross-Chain Communication

## Problem
- Storing entire blockchains of other chains is impractical
- Would cause exponential state growth as more connections are added

## Solution
- Use light clients for cross-chain tracking

**Implementation**:
- Chains store light clients of other chains in their state machines
- Requires very little space compared to storing full nodes
- Can still verify information without trusting relayers

## Relayer Role
- Relayers submit proofs of packet submission
- Light clients can verify these proofs independently

# Key Points

1. **Full nodes** provide complete access but require significant storage
2. **Light clients** offer efficient tracking with minimal storage requirements
3. Cross-chain communication uses **light clients** to avoid state explosion
4. Light clients can **verify proofs** provided by full nodes or relayers
5. This system allows for **trustless verification** of cross-chain information

This approach enables efficient and secure cross-chain communication without the need to store entire blockchains of connected chains.
