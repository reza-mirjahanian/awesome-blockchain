### Chainflow: Validator Operations, Philosophy, and Decentralization in Cosmos

Chainflow has been operating since unofficially 2016. We validate on approximately 15 different networks with a small team. We have taken no outside investment and have remained independent, which differentiates us. Our goal is to build infrastructure that enables an alternative to the current economy, which we view as inequitable, unfair, and imbalanced. Through this infrastructure, we aim to establish a foundation for a more fair, equitable, and accessible economy for a wider segment of humanity.

Staying independent limits our resources but aligns with our values. We started before or alongside many larger staking companies, but we rejected the high-growth, growth-at-all-costs Silicon Valley model. This model captures market share, which can lead to centralization—orthogonal to crypto's decentralized values. Instead, we prioritized running validators securely and reliably.

Early advantages came from launching at genesis and building track records through early involvement. However, as networks mature (two to three years in), this fades. Challenges include limited visibility due to lacking marketing and business development resources compared to larger validators. We lead with decentralized-first values, but in a noisy environment, this work can go unseen.

To address visibility, we focus on contributing value to supported networks. We plan to concentrate on fewer networks for deeper involvement, potentially winding down on others. Contributions include community-led validator calls on Solana to supplement official ones. We aim to make targeted, valuable inputs, strengthen social presence, and connect with delegators who share our values, earning delegation through demonstrated contributions.

#### Evaluating Projects for Validation

Validators lend their reputation when validating a blockchain, effectively endorsing it. We evaluate projects using a structured process refined over years.

Initially (around 2017), with few launches like Cosmos, we adopted a broad "spray and pray" approach due to uncertainty. Over time, patterns emerged: some networks followed through, others did not.

**Key Filters:**

1. **Alignment with Decentralized Values**  
   We assess if the team believes in decentralization's potential and is willing to make sacrifices for it. Decentralization is hard—centralization is convenient initially, but true projects progressively decentralize by releasing control and tolerating messiness. We seek teams building from a decentralized-first perspective, not just claiming it.

2. **Team Commitment**  
   We evaluate if the team lives these values. This includes intuitive reads on motivation: genuine belief in a censorship-resistant future versus capitalizing on financial hype. Conversations with team members reveal this—teams driven by better futures differ from opportunistic ones.

3. **Initial Token Distribution as a Barometer**  
   Tokenomics indicate intent. Projects spun from big tech with insider-controlled allocations (e.g., majority vested in the company) struggle to decentralize. In contrast, community-based distributions—retaining enough for the team but allocating to community members—signal commitment. We look for "walking the walk, not just talking the talk." Beware "DINO" (decentralized in name only) projects where actions contradict rhetoric.

4. **Technological Merit**  
   Is the technology competitive? Does it offer advantages over existing networks or enable unique use cases?

5. **Economic Viability**  
   The network must be profitable long-term. As a self-funded operation, we cross-subsidize across networks but cannot sustain unprofitable ones indefinitely.

**Process Details:**  
- **Early Engagement:** Talk to teams early. Permissionless sets were easier initially; now, gates (e.g., testnets, approvals) provide interaction opportunities. By launch, we've had multiple conversations with key members to gauge alignment.  
- **Ongoing Assessment:** Once involved, monitor steps toward decentralization (e.g., governance, token unlocks).  
- **Nature of Project:** We consider both mindset and mechanics. Roadmaps, token distribution at genesis, and vesting schedules matter. For example, chains issuing stablecoins like USDC may prioritize different decentralization paths than general-purpose chains, but all must show gradual progress. We weigh team communications (verbal and written, e.g., Medium posts, whitepapers) heavily, with direct talks providing the clearest read.

To summarize: First, values and ethics (decentralization mindset). Second, success potential (traction for economic sustainability, preserving values).

#### Cosmos Governance in Context

Cosmos has the most active governance process among networks we support. Within the Cosmos ecosystem, governance is highly engaged, with frequent proposals, discussions, and community participation. This contrasts with other ecosystems, where activity is lower or more centralized.

Key strengths in Cosmos:  
- **Progressive Decentralization:** Teams release control over time, enabling messy but resilient growth.  
- **Community Coordination:** Human and social elements around simple tooling drive effective governance. Tooling can be straightforward; the challenge lies in coordination.  

Compared to others:  
- Networks like Solana benefit from supplemental community calls but have less baked-in governance activity.  
- Broader crypto: Many claim decentralization but centralize via insider control or low engagement. Cosmos exemplifies walking the walk through active, values-aligned processes.

We support Cosmos due to its alignment: committed teams, competitive tech (e.g., SDK for app-chains), and profitability via staking rewards. Ongoing contributions, like focused validator operations, reinforce this.
