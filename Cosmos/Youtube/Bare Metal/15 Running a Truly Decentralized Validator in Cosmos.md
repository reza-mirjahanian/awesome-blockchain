## Kleomedes: Running a Decentralized Validator in Cosmos

**Kleomedes** is a **Decentralized Validator Organization (DOV)** focused on proving that a community-owned and operated validator can be competitive and successful on the Cosmos Network. The goal is to involve community members in the governance of the organization and the chains it validates.

***

### Validator Infrastructure and Operations

Kleomedes operates a **bare metal** validation setup located in Italy.

* **Hardware Ownership:** The organization owns and internally hosts all its hardware.
* **Security and Redundancy:** The setup is maintained with high standards, including a **generator**, backup Wi-Fi, and 5G network backups to ensure a robust, high-availability service comparable to a modern data center.

***

### Project Selection Strategy

Validator project selection is based on long-term commitment and organizational alignment:

* **Ethos Alignment:** Priority is placed on connecting with core teams to ensure **long-term ethos alignment** and shared values.
* **Meaningful Contribution:** Kleomedes seeks to actively participate and help chains grow, avoiding partnerships with projects lacking a stable or sustainable foundation.

### The Need for Decentralized Validators (DOVs)

The DOV structure is a response to core scaling and centralization concerns within the Cosmos ecosystem:

* **Consensus Limitation:** The current consensus engine has an inherent limit of **200 to 300 active validators**. This hard-coded constraint will increase competition as the ecosystem grows.
* **Risk of Centralization:** Increased profitability drives the formation of large, successful **centralized corporations** that operate as corporate validators. These organizations often lack transparency in their internal operations, processes, and compensation structures.
* **DOV Mission:** The DOV is designed to counteract this trend by offering a transparent, community-controlled alternative, proving that decentralized organizations can overcome organizational challenges to compete with centralized corporate entities.

### DAO Membership and Tokenomics (CLIO)

Kleomedes is structured as a **contributor-owned organization**, where ownership is primarily earned through effort rather than capital.

* **CLIO Token:** The CLIO token represents both ownership and governance rights within the DAO.
* **Contributor Model:** The tokenomics are set up so that those who actively **contribute** to the DAO earn ownership, discouraging a simple "buy-your-way-in" market approach.
* **Revenue Share:** CLIO is a revenue share token. Staking CLIO grants a share of the validator profits generated across all chains. The ultimate goal is for stakers to earn a **basket of native assets** from all validated Cosmos chains.

### Governance and Profit Distribution

The DAO structure separates the validator's commission-based profit from the responsibility of governance, ensuring transparency and community control over funds.

#### 1. Financial Transparency and Control
* **Profit Allocation:** All delegation commissions are controlled by the decentralized structure. CLIO holders vote on proposals to determine how profits are spent and to adjust allocation ratios for different purposes.

#### 2. Scalable Governance through Sub-Councils
To manage the complexity of validating multiple chains, Kleomedes established a system of **sub-councils** in its on-chain constitution:

* **Function:** Contributors can choose to focus on specific chains, forming councils that act as leaders for that chain within the DAO.
* **Contribution:** These councils represent Kleomedes to the chain's community, manage communication, support education, and handle the non-infrastructure roles that can overwhelm a small team.

#### 3. DAO Participation in Strategy
DAO members participate in core strategic operations, such as developing expansion plans:

* **Example:** When expanding to chains like **Akash**, contributors perform cross-chain data analysis (wallet conversions, staking analysis) to model potential delegation size within the existing community. The DAO then votes on specific incentive programs (e.g., issuing CLIO rewards to initial delegators) required to enter a new active set.

### Dynamic Commission and Ecosystem Health

Kleomedes implements a dynamic commission strategy designed to maintain a healthy delegation size and support the overall decentralization of the ecosystem.

#### 1. Dynamic Commission Tiers
Commission rates adjust based on the validator’s ranking in the active set:
* **Low Rank:** Commission may be temporarily lowered to encourage delegations and reach a stable, competitive rank.
* **Stable Rank (~75th Percentile):** Commission is set at a **5% standard**.
* **High Rank (~Top 10 Percentile):** Commission is gradually **increased weekly** to prevent the validator's delegation weight from growing excessively large.

#### 2. Nakamoto Coefficient Balancing
If the validator's delegation size continues to grow beyond a healthy limit, a **delegation program** is activated:
* Excess profits are delegated to **smaller validators** on the same chain.
* **Outcome:** This mechanism balances the chain's **Nakamoto coefficient** (a measure of decentralization) while still ensuring the Kleomedes treasury generates income from those delegations.

#### 3. Minimum Commission Rationale
The dynamic commission structure respects the purpose of the minimum commission rule, which is to:
* Establish a **floor** to prevent low-quality validators from growing unnaturally by offering 0% commissions.
* Ensure validators are compensated enough to afford to perform the necessary, high-quality work and contribution to the blockchain.

### Contributor Engagement and Tooling

A multi-stage process and specific tooling are used to filter and engage high-quality contributors:

* **Stage 1: Gamified Screening (Crew³ / Zealy):** This platform is used for initial engagement, employing quests, levels, and leaderboards. Tasks are structured to progressively increase in complexity, filtering out passive participants by requiring high-effort contributions like **content creation** and in-depth analysis.
* **Stage 2: Project Management (Wonderverse):** This serves as a secondary platform for managing projects and discussions, aiming to be a more web3-centric, permanent knowledge base.
* **Current Governance Tooling:** **Dao Dao** is used for all on-chain proposal and governance management.
* **Future AI Tooling:** Kleomedes is working with **Algovera** (a blockchain-based AI group) to develop a tool that will **scrub and summarize** conversations across all platforms (Discord, Twitter, forums). The goal is to provide council leaders and members with a clear, consolidated picture of complex governance discussions, facilitating better decision-making.
