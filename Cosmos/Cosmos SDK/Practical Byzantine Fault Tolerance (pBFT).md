**Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT)** is one of these optimizations and was introduced by Miguel Castro and Barbara Liskov in an academic paper in 1999 titled "[Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance](http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf)".

It aims to improve upon original BFT consensus mechanisms and has been implemented and enhanced in several modern distributed [computer](https://blockonomi.com/bluehost-coupon-code/) systems, including some popular blockchain [platforms](https://blockonomi.com/siteground-coupon-code/).




| Key Facts | Description |
| --- |  --- |
| Consensus Models | Critical for the functionality of distributed blockchain systems, enabling trustless interactions between users. |
| --- |  --- |
| Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) | A network's capacity to reach consensus despite having nodes that may fail or act maliciously. |
| Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT) | An optimization of BFT, introduced by Miguel Castro and Barbara Liskov in 1999, implemented in modern systems to improve performance and security. |
| pBFT Algorithm | Works under the assumption that less than 1/3 of the nodes are malicious. It provides both liveness and safety and ensures linearizability, meaning that client requests yield correct responses. |
| pBFT Node Structure | Consists of one primary (leader) node and multiple backup nodes, where the leader is changed in a round robin manner. |
| pBFT Communication and Phases | Heavy inter-node communication with 4 phases: a client's request to the leader, multicast to backups, execution and reply, and the client awaits f+1f+1 matching replies. |
| Transaction Finality and Energy Efficiency | pBFT provides immediate transaction finality and is less energy-intensive compared to Proof-of-Work models, thereby reducing the network's energy consumption. |
| Limitations | Best suited for small consensus groups due to heavy communication overhead. The algorithm's scalability and high-throughput capability diminish as the network size increases. |
| Message Authentication | Utilizes digital signatures and multisignatures rather than MACs for efficient authentication in large groups, improving over the original pBFT's limitations. |
| Susceptibility to Attacks | Vulnerable to Sybil attacks, although mitigated by larger network sizes. The challenge remains to maintain security while overcoming communication limits for scalability. |
| Modern Implementations | Blockchain platforms like Zilliqa use optimized pBFT for high throughput, combined with PoW for additional security in their consensus model. Hyperledger Fabric uses a permissioned pBFT variant, benefiting from smaller, known consensus groups for high transaction throughput. |
| Importance for Cryptocurrencies | Advanced BFT mechanisms are crucial for the integrity and trustless nature of large-scale public blockchain systems, with pBFT being a foundational technology for many current cryptocurrencies. |

An Overview of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance
--------------------------------------------------

The pBFT model primarily focuses on providing a practical Byzantine state machine replication that tolerates Byzantine faults (malicious nodes) through an assumption that there are independent node failures and manipulated messages propagated by specific, independent nodes.

The algorithm is designed to work in asynchronous systems and is optimized to be high-performance with an impressive overhead runtime and only a slight increase in latency.

-   Essentially, all of the nodes in the pBFT model are ordered in a sequence with one node being the primary node (leader) and the others referred to as the backup nodes.
-   All of the nodes within the system communicate with each other and the goal is for all of the honest nodes to come to an agreement of the state of the system through a majority.
-   Nodes communicate with each other heavily, and not only have to prove that messages came from a specific peer node, but also need to verify that the message was not modified during transmission.
