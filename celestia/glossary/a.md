##   Composability
    
    The ability for applications on a blockchain to read and write state to each other.
    
##    Consensus
    
    A function of modular blockchains where the ordering of transactions is agreed upon by a set of validators.



## Consensus algorithm

	A consensus algorithm is a set of rules that blockchains use to determine how nodes produce new blocks and agree to finalize them.


DA stands for Data Availability.

DAC stands for Data Availability Committee.

DAS stands for Data Availability Sampling.


## Data availability sampling
A technique in which nodes can verify that data is available for a block without having to download the entire block, formerly known as data availability proofs.


## Data availability
The condition of whether or not transaction data was made available for nodes to download, when a block was proposed.

## Data availability committee
A data availability committee (DAC) is a permissioned group of nodes responsible for providing data availability to a blockchain.


## Data availability layer
A blockchain that provides data availability for other types of chains, like rollups.

## Data withholding attack
A type of attack that occurs when a block producer proposes a new block but does not share the underlying transaction data that was used to create the block.


## Dispute resolution
The handling and resolution of disputes, commonly used as a term in relation to optimistic rollups and their fraud proof mechanism.
