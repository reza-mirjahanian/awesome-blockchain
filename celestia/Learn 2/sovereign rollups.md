#### Summary

-   Sovereign rollups publish transactions to another blockchain for ordering and data availability, leaving its nodes to determine the correct chain.
-   The main difference between a smart contract rollup and sovereign rollup is that transactions are verified by a smart contract on Ethereum and the sovereign rollup nodes, respectively.
-   Contrary to popular belief, sovereign rollups do inherit multiple aspects of security and they can have a bridge to the DA layer.
