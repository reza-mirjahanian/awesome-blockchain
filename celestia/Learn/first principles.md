#### Summary

-   Modular blockchains prioritize decentralization for network security by reducing the cost for users to operate nodes and verify the network.
-   Scaling enables modular blockchains to increase capacity without making it costly for users to verify and secure the network.
-   A decentralized network of users are ultimately responsible for upholding the security of a blockchain in the presence of malicious validators.
