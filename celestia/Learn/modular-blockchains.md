##### Modular chains let you create open access for all

But, if people can't afford to check the chain, then it's not that much different than using a centralized application. That's why it's essential to keep it inexpensive for people to confirm the blockchain is running correctly.

Technologies like data availability sampling and [fraud](https://celestia.org/glossary/state-transition-fraud-proof/) or [validity proofs](https://celestia.org/glossary/validity-proof/) are used by modular blockchains to make this possible. As you journey down the modular rabbit hole, you'll see these terms come up quite a bit. All you need to know for now is that they can help make blockchains really inexpensive for people to check they're running correctly.
