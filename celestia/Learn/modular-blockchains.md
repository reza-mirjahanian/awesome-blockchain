##### Modular chains let you create open access for all

But, if people can't afford to check the chain, then it's not that much different than using a centralized application. That's why it's essential to keep it inexpensive for people to confirm the blockchain is running correctly.

Technologies like data availability sampling and [fraud](https://celestia.org/glossary/state-transition-fraud-proof/) or [validity proofs](https://celestia.org/glossary/validity-proof/) are used by modular blockchains to make this possible. 


#### Summary

-   **Execution** is like playing a football game according to the rules and figuring out the final score.
-   **Settlement** is similar to solving arguments during a football game.
-   **Consensus** is like agreeing to watch the same football game as your friend.
-   **Data availability** is similar to streaming and recording a football game.
