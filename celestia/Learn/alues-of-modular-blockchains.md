#### Summary

-   Modular blockchains make users first class citizens by enabling them to directly verify the blockchain.
-   Modularism, not maximalism: building blockchain infrastructure should be collaborative, not competitive.
-   Modular blockchains enable communities to become sovereign, enabling them to self-organize independently.
-   

#### Users are first-class citizens

The point of open blockchains is that they are verifiable. Anybody should be able to run a node and personally verify that the network is operating correctly. While [validators](https://celestia.org/glossary/validator) are responsible for processing transactions, the users who run nodes make sure that validators are behaving correctly. If a validator decides to act negatively, users can verify the behavior and punish it accordingly - through on-chain penalties like [slashing](https://celestia.org/glossary/slashing) or socially through forking.
