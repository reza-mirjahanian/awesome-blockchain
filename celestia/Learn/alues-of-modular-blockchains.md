#### Summary

-   Modular blockchains make users first class citizens by enabling them to directly verify the blockchain.
-   Modularism, not maximalism: building blockchain infrastructure should be collaborative, not competitive.
-   Modular blockchains enable communities to become sovereign, enabling them to self-organize independently.
-   

#### Users are first-class citizens

The point of open blockchains is that they are verifiable. Anybody should be able to run a node and personally verify that the network is operating correctly. While [validators](https://celestia.org/glossary/validator) are responsible for processing transactions, the users who run nodes make sure that validators are behaving correctly. If a validator decides to act negatively, users can verify the behavior and punish it accordingly - through on-chain penalties like [slashing](https://celestia.org/glossary/slashing) or socially through forking.

----
Since blockchains depend on users running nodes to keep the network secure, modular blockchains aim to minimize the **cost of running** a node. If running a node is too expensive, not many users will be able to afford it. This reduces the security of the chain, which could make it easier to attack.

With new innovations like [fraud](https://celestia.org/glossary/state-transition-fraud-proof/) or [validity proofs](https://celestia.org/glossary/validity-proof/) and [data availability sampling](https://celestia.org/glossary/data-availability-sampling/), users can run a low-cost node that has the same security as a more expensive full node. By keeping the cost low for users to run nodes, they can personally verify and participate as first-class citizens of the network.
