Staking in crypto refers to the process of participating in the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism of a blockchain by locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency to support network operations such as block validation and security. There are several types of staking mechanisms used in different blockchain networks:

### Types of Staking in Crypto

1. **Proof of Stake (PoS)**:
   - **Definition**: Participants lock up their tokens to become validators. Validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the number of tokens they have staked.
   - **Example**: Ethereum 2.0

2. **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**:
   - **Definition**: Token holders vote for a small number of delegates (validators) to secure the network. The more tokens a delegate has, the more likely they are to be selected to create a block.
   - **Example**: EOS, TRON

3. **Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS)**:
   - **Definition**: Similar to PoS, but validators must bond their tokens for a specific period. The bonded tokens can be slashed if the validator acts maliciously.
   - **Example**: Cosmos, Polkadot

4. **Liquid Proof of Stake (LPoS)**:
   - **Definition**: Combines aspects of traditional PoS and DPoS. Token holders can stake their tokens directly or delegate them to validators.
   - **Example**: Tezos

5. **Hybrid Proof of Stake (Hybrid PoS)**:
   - **Definition**: Combines PoS with another consensus mechanism, like proof of work (PoW), to enhance security and decentralization.
   - **Example**: Decred

6. **Leased Proof of Stake (LPoS)**:
   - **Definition**: Token holders can lease their tokens to full nodes, which then use the combined stake to increase their chances of being selected to validate transactions.
   - **Example**: Waves

7. **Cold Staking**:
   - **Definition**: Allows token holders to stake their tokens without keeping them in a hot wallet, reducing the risk of theft.
   - **Example**: NavCoin, Stratis

8. **Staking Pools**:
   - **Definition**: A group of token holders combine their resources to increase their chances of being selected as validators. Rewards are distributed proportionally among participants.
   - **Example**: PoolTogether, Rocket Pool

9. **Masternode Staking**:
   - **Definition**: Involves setting up a masternode, which requires a significant amount of tokens to be staked. Masternodes perform additional functions like governance and instant transactions.
   - **Example**: Dash, PIVX

10. **Staking-as-a-Service**:
    - **Definition**: Third-party platforms offer staking services, managing the technical aspects on behalf of token holders in exchange for a fee.
    - **Example**: Coinbase, Binance Staking

11. **Yield Farming**:
    - **Definition**: A form of staking in the DeFi ecosystem where users provide liquidity to decentralized exchanges or lending platforms in exchange for rewards.
    - **Example**: Uniswap, Compound

12. **Synthetic Staking**:
    - **Definition**: Involves staking synthetic assets, which are tokenized representations of other assets, providing a way to earn staking rewards without holding the actual underlying asset.
    - **Example**: Synthetix

13. Cross-Chain Staking:

      Staking assets on one blockchain to secure another
      Often used in interoperability protocols
      Example: Cosmos Network


14. Non-Custodial Staking:

      Staking directly from a user's wallet without transferring assets to a third party
      Maintains full control over assets
