Contracts are deployed using transactions where:


●   **To** address is not specified.

●   **Data** is the init code fragment. This includes the contract binary. This is the compiler output in the *.bin file.


Note:


●   The **init** function is NOT stored on the blockchain.
●   The Data of the transaction is treated as code for contract deployment.
