### 🚀 **EIP-7702: Native Account Abstraction**  
### **EIP-7702: The Next Evolution of Account Abstraction** 🚀

* **Coming Soon:** Scheduled to ship with the Pectra hard fork.
* **Core Goal:** To bring smart contract functionality directly to Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), the standard user accounts on Ethereum.
* **It's a Big Deal:** This EIP represents a significant step towards making Ethereum accounts more powerful and user-friendly.

---

### **Recap: What is Account Abstraction?** 🤔

* **The Vision:** To allow user accounts (EOAs) to behave like smart contracts.
* **Benefits Include:**
    * **Gas Sponsorship:** Third parties can pay for a user's transaction fees.
    * **Transaction Batching:** Execute multiple operations (e.g., approve and swap) in a single transaction.
    * **Social Recovery:** Regain access to an account without a seed phrase.
    * **Custom Logic:** Implement unique security rules, like daily spending limits.

---

### **The Journey to Native AA: EIP-4337** 🗺️

* **A Clever Workaround:** EIP-4337 introduced account abstraction *without* a core protocol change (a hard fork).
* **How it Works:** It's a standard that uses an off-chain infrastructure of "Bundlers" and a global "EntryPoint" smart contract to simulate smart contract wallet functionality.
* **The Downside:**
    * **Migration Required:** Users had to move their assets from their existing EOA to a *new* smart contract wallet. This created friction and slowed adoption.
    * **Off-Chain Reliance:** The system depends on a separate, off-chain network of bundlers to process user operations.

---

### **EIP-7702: Native Account Abstraction Arrives** ✨

* **The Big Leap:** EIP-7702 integrates smart contract capabilities *directly into your existing EOA*.
* **Key Features:**
    * **No Migration:** Keep your current address, ENS name, and transaction history.
    * **On-Chain Logic:** No reliance on off-chain bundlers.
    * **User-Initiated Upgrade:** An EOA is "upgraded" via a simple signature, granting it programmable functionality.

---

### **How EIP-7702 Works: A New Transaction Type** transaksi

* **The Core Innovation:** The EIP introduces a new transaction type that can temporarily set the `code` for an EOA *for the duration of that single transaction*.
* **Ethereum Account Basics:**
    * **EOAs:** Controlled by private keys. Historically, their `code hash` field is empty.     * **Contract Accounts:** Controlled by their code. Their `code hash` field points to their smart contract bytecode.
* **The Change:** EIP-7702 allows an EOA's `code hash` to be temporarily populated, effectively making it a smart contract for one transaction.

---

### **The "Delegation Designator"** 📝

* **The Pointer:** When an EOA is upgraded, its `code` field isn't filled with extensive smart contract logic. Instead, it gets a simple, standardized piece of bytecode called the **Delegation Designator**.
* **What it Contains:**
    1.  **Prefix:** A standard 2-byte prefix (`0xEF00`) to identify it.
    2.  **Version:** A version number (e.g., `0x00`).
    3.  **Address:** The address of a smart contract wallet implementation whose logic the EOA wants to use.
* **In short:** The EOA doesn't store the logic itself; it just points to a trusted, on-chain contract that has the logic.

---

### **The Execution Flow: A `DELEGATECALL` in Disguise** 🎭

* **Redirection:** When a transaction calls an upgraded EOA, the EVM sees the Delegation Designator in the `code` field.
* **Context Preservation:** The EVM then redirects the call to the smart contract address specified in the designator.
* **Crucial Detail:** This redirection works like a `DELEGATECALL`.
    * The code of the smart contract wallet is executed...
    * ...but in the **context of the EOA's state**.
* **This means:** The logic operates on the EOA's balance, nonce, and storage, not the smart contract's. The EOA is the one making the call and paying the gas.

---

### **Upgrading Your EOA: The Authorization List** ✅

* **The Mechanism:** The new transaction type includes a field called the `authorization_list`.
* **What is an Authorization?** It's a signed message from an EOA owner that grants permission for the upgrade. It contains:
    * `chain_id`: Prevents replay attacks on other chains.
    * `address`: The smart contract wallet to delegate to.
    * `nonce`: Prevents replay attacks.
    * `signature`: The EOA owner's cryptographic proof of consent.
* **The Process (Pre-Execution):**
    1.  The EVM loops through the `authorization_list` in the transaction.
    2.  For each authorization, it verifies the signature.
    3.  If valid, it checks the account's `code`.
        * If the `code` is empty (a standard EOA), it sets the Delegation Designator.
        * If `code` already contains a designator, it updates it to the new one.
        * If `code` contains other bytecode (meaning it's already a smart contract), it does nothing and moves on.
        

#### *“Smart-contract super-powers for every EOA – no migration, no extra infra”*

---

### 🧩 **The Big Picture**
- **Goal:** Give every externally-owned account (EOA) the features of a smart-contract wallet **without** forcing users to switch addresses or depend on off-chain bundlers.  
- **Ships with:** **Pectra** (next Ethereum hard-fork)  
- **Motto:** *“Your key, your address, now with programmable logic.”*

### 🔄 **Why Not Just Use EIP-4337?**
| EIP-4337 (Status-Quo) | EIP-7702 (Upgrade) |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Separate **smart-contract wallet** address 🆕 | Keep **same EOA** address ✅ |
| Needs **UserOps + Bundlers** ⚙️ | Single **new tx type** only 🖋️ |
| Off-chain infra dependency 🌐 | **100 % on-chain** 🏗️ |
| Migration friction 🚚 | Zero migration 🚀 |

---

### 🏗️ **Core Mechanism in One Slide**
> “Add a new transaction type that **permanently sets code** for an EOA.”

1. **Delegation Designator**  
   - 3-byte prefix: `0xef0100`  
   - 20-byte address → smart-contract wallet logic  
   - Stored in `codeHash` of the EOA state  

2. **Effect:**  
   - Any `CALL` to the EOA → **delegated to the wallet contract**  
   - Context remains the EOA (balance, nonce, storage) 🎯  
   - Gas sponsorship, batching, recovery, etc. **just work** ✨

---

### 🔐 **Authorization Flow**
- **New tx type** contains an `authorization_list`  
  Each entry:
  ```
  chain_id      – replay protection
  address       – wallet logic to delegate to
  nonce         – anti-replay
  yParity,r,s   – ECDSA signature from EOA owner
  ```

- **EVM Pre-execution loop**  
  1. Verify signature & nonce  
  2. If `codeHash == keccak('')` → write delegation designator  
  3. Else skip (already a contract or already delegated)

---

### 🧪 **Code-Level Glimpse (Rust-style pseudocode)**
```rust
// Inside reth/execution
for auth in tx.authorization_list {
    let recovered = recover_signer(auth.signature)?;
    ensure!(recovered.nonce == state.nonce(recovered.addr));
    if state.code_hash(recovered.addr) == KECCAK_EMPTY {
        let mut code = vec![0xEF, 0x01, 0x00];
        code.extend(auth.delegate_address.as_bytes());
        state.set_code(recovered.addr, code);
    }
}
```

---

### 🎨 **Delegation Bytecode Format**
| Bytes | Meaning | Hex |
|-------|---------|-----|
| 0-2   | EIP-7702 prefix | `EF 01 00` |
| 3-22  | Delegate target address | `a0b1c2…` |

---

### 🌟 **Instant Super-Powers Unlocked**
- **🔥 Gas Abstraction** – Pay fees in USDC, DAI, or by a 3rd-party paymaster  
- **📦 Batch Transactions** – One signature, multiple calls (approve + swap)  
- **🔑 Social Recovery** – Replace lost keys via guardians without moving funds  
- **🔐 Role-based Limits** – Daily spend, function-level permissions  
- **🧾 Session Keys** – Temporary keys for dApps with custom scopes

---

### 🔍 **Deep Dive: Storage & Context**
- **Storage root** → still the EOA’s own storage  
- **Balance** → still the EOA’s balance  
- Only `bytecode` is swapped for the delegation designator  
  → behaves like `DELEGATECALL` to the wallet logic contract

---

### 🚦 **Security Guardrails**
- **One-way upgrade** – once delegated, can’t revert to empty code (only re-delegate)  
- **Signature required** – chain-id replay protection & nonce  
- **No overwriting contracts** – existing contracts are ignored in auth list  
- **Visible on explorers** – delegation address is public & auditable

---

### 🔗 **Synergy with Other EIPs**
- **EIP-3074** (`AUTH`/`AUTHCALL`) – similar spirit but needs off-chain sponsor; 7702 is fully on-chain  
- **EIP-5003** – potential future “code-clearing” mechanism  
- **ERC-4337 account extensions** – wallet logic can still be ERC-4337 compatible

---

### 🛠️ **Downstream Tooling Impact**
- **Wallet Apps** – add “one-click upgrade to smart wallet” UX  
- **Block Explorers** – show delegation pointer & wallet features  
- **Auditors** – new bytecode pattern to whitelist (`0xEF0100…`)  
- **RPC / Indexers** – track `authorization_list` receipts for analytics

---

### 🎮 **Quick Demo Scenario**
1. Alice EOA `0x1234…` signs an EIP-7702 tx  
2. Delegates to `0xABCD…` (Safe v1.6 singleton)  
3. Next send: `from: 0x1234…, to: Uniswap, value: 0, data: swap()`  
4. EVM intercepts → `DELEGATECALL` to Safe logic  
5. Safe pays gas in USDC, batching approval + swap in one tx 🎉

---

### 🧰 **Developer Cheat-Sheet**
- **Create delegation tx**  
  ```python
  auth = {
    "chainId": 1,
    "address": "0xSafeSingleton",
    "nonce": provider.get_nonce(my_eoa),
  }
  signed = eoa_sign(auth)  # EIP-191 personal_sign style
  tx = {
    "type": 4,
    "authorizationList": [signed],
    ...
  }
  ```

- **Check if upgraded**  
  ```solidity
  function is7702(address who) external view returns (bool) {
      bytes memory code = who.code;
      return code.length == 23 && bytes3(code) == 0xef0100;
  }
  ```

### 🆚 **EOA vs 7702 vs Contract Wallet**
| Feature | Plain EOA | EIP-7702 EOA | Contract Wallet |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Address | ✅ same | ✅ same | ❌ new |
| Key Loss | 🔴 unrecoverable | 🟢 recoverable via delegate | 🟢 recoverable |
| Gas Payer | ETH only | ETH / ERC-20 / paymaster | ETH / ERC-20 / paymaster |
| Upgrade Flexibility | ❌ none | 🟡 re-delegate only | 🟢 full upgradeable code |
| Deployment Cost | 0 gas | ~21 k gas (once) | >100 k gas |

---

### 📡 **Network Readiness**
- **Pectra fork** – devnets active, spec frozen 🧪  
- **revm / reth / Foundry** – already support EIP-7702 in nightly builds  
- **Wallet vendors** – MetaMask, Safe, Rabby planning UI flows  
- **Audits / fuzzing** – ongoing by EF, Spearbit, Trail of Bits

---

### 🎯 **Design Highlights**
- **Minimal consensus change** – only new tx type & pre-execution hook  
- **Zero new opcodes** – reuses existing `DELEGATECALL` semantics  
- **Backwards compatible** – EOAs that never upgrade behave exactly as before  
- **Forward compatible** – future 7702 v2 can extend prefix `0xEF0101`, etc.

---

### 🌐 **Ecosystem Ripple Effects**
- **NFT marketplaces** – can sponsor gas for first-time users  
- **Games** – session keys with custom rule sets  
- **DeFi aggregators** – single-signature multicall bundles  
- **Social logins** – Web2 auth providers can fund onboarding txs for free

---

### 🧩 **Fun Facts & Trivia**
- **Prefix trivia:** `0xEF` is the same magic byte used by EOF (EIP-3540) to avoid collision  
- **Address reuse:** delegation address can be the same for millions of EOAs → singleton pattern  
- **Vanity addresses:** still work because delegation doesn’t change the address itself  
- **ENS names:** resolve to the same ENS record after upgrade 🪄

---

### 📊 **Gas & Storage Footprint**
| Operation | Approx Gas | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Set delegation code | 21 000 | Same as basic transfer |
| Re-delegate | 5 000 | SSTORE reset discount |
| Query code (RPC) | 0 | Off-chain, constant time |
| Wallet logic call | +delegate gas | Same as calling wallet directly |

---

### 🔐 **Signature Scheme Details**
- **EIP-191** personal_sign style  
- **EIP-712** typed data variant being discussed for better wallet UX  
- **Replay protection:** `chain_id + nonce` baked into auth struct  
- **Malleability:** `yParity` (v) explicitly encoded → no ECDSA malleability issues

---

### 🧪 **Testing Checklist for Devs**
- [ ] Generate auth list with correct nonce  
- [ ] Send type-4 tx on devnet  
- [ ] Verify `eth_getCode` returns 23 bytes starting with `0xef0100`  
- [ ] Simulate failed re-delegate to a **contract** (should skip)  
- [ ] Check gas sponsorship via delegate wallet logic  
- [ ] Validate replay fails with reused nonce
