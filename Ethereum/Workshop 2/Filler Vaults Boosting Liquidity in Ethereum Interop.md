# Filler Vaults: Boosting Liquidity in Ethereum Interop 🌉💰

---

## 🎯 The Challenge: Liquidity & Competition in Intent-Based Interoperability

### 🚨 Problem 1: Insufficient Liquidity
*   **User Experience Bottleneck:** Users attempting common cross-chain actions (e.g., bridging 600,000 DAI from Arbitrum One to Optimism) often find **no available filler** to execute the intent.
    *   💡 *Example:* Screenshot shows failed bridge due to lack of liquidity.
*   **Long-Tail Woes:** Liquidity for mainstream assets between major chains is challenging; for niche tokens or newer chains, it's **significantly worse**.
    *   🎯 Imagine attempting to bridge a lesser-known token or to a recently launched chain – liquidity is often **non-existent**.

### ⚖️ Problem 2: Concentrated Filler Power
*   **Dominance Risk:** A small number of fillers (or even a single entity) can dominate transaction volume on bridges.
    *   📊 *Example:* Across Bridge statistics show **63% of volume cleared by one solver**.
*   **Economic Implications:**
    *   **High Entry Barriers:** Significant capital and operational costs deter new fillers.
    *   **Congestion Costs:** Operational overhead for fillers.
    *   **Monopolistic Pricing:** Lack of competition can lead to **higher fees/convenience taxes** for users.

## 💡 The Solution: Filler Vaults (Filts) 🏦

### 🧠 Core Concept
*   **Inspiration:** Modeled after **Hyperliquid's HLP Vaults**.
    *   🎯 Hyperliquid used vaults to channel liquidity to its perpetual exchange, increasing competitiveness.
*   **Purpose:** Deepen liquidity in **intent-based interoperability markets**.
    *   🔄 *Intent-Based Interop:* Users express desired outcomes (e.g., "send X token to chain Y"), and fillers execute the underlying transactions.

### 🌟 Key Advantages of Filler Vaults
*   **Democratization of Filling:**
    *   📈 Makes it easier for a wider range of participants to become fillers by pooling capital.
    *   💼 Reduces individual capital requirements and entry barriers.
*   **Targeted Liquidity Provision:**
    *   🎯 **Specific Route/Token Support:** Anyone (L2s, communities, individuals) can create a vault focused on specific chains or tokens.
    *   🤝 *Example:* A new L2 could launch its own filler vault to improve bridging *to* its network, funding it directly or rallying community support.

## ⚙️ How Filler Vaults Work

### 🧠 Mental Model
*   **On-Chain Vault + Off-Chain Strategy:**
    *   Vaults provide the **capital** needed on destination chains.
    *   Off-chain strategies define the **logic** for when and how to fill intents using that capital.

### 🔐 Verifiability & Security
*   **Execution Verification:** Ensuring off-chain strategies execute correctly is crucial.
*   **Verification Methods (Flexible):**
    *   🔐 **Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs:** Cryptographically prove correct execution.
    *   🧾 **Attestations:** Trusted authorities (or a quorum) verify execution.
    *   🔒 **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs):** Run strategy in a secure, isolated environment.
    *   👥 *Market Choice:* Vault creators decide the level of security/guarantee required.

### 🧱 Core Components Needed
1.  **Off-Chain Infrastructure:** Hosts and runs the filling strategies.
2.  **On-Chain Verification Mechanism:** Smart contracts to verify strategy execution and release vault funds.
    *   🧩 *Lego Blocks:* Platforms like **Socket** provide these components.

## 🛠️ Implementation with Socket & Across (MVP Example)

### 🌐 Socket: The Developer Abstraction Layer
*   **EVMX (EVM eXtended):** An EVM-powered environment that simplifies cross-chain development.
    *   🚫 Abstracts away: Reliable RPC connections, asynchronous flows, complex cross-chain reads/writes.
    *   💡 *Dev Perspective:* Write smart contracts as if all chains were one synchronous domain.
*   **Switchboards:** Modular on-chain security components for verifying off-chain execution.
    *   🛡️ Examples: Fast Switchboard (trusted attestation), ZK Switchboard, TEE Switchboard.

### 🧪 MVP Scope & Flow (Arbitrum Sepolia → Optimism Sepolia, USDC)
*   **Goal:** Demonstrate a simple, end-to-end filler vault system.
*   **Direction:** One-way bridging of USDC from Arbitrum Sepolia to Optimism Sepolia.
*   **Protocol:** Uses **Across Protocol** for intent auctioning and settlement.

### 🔧 MVP Components

#### 1. **Filler Vault (On-Chain - Optimism Sepolia)**
*   **Standard:** ERC-4626 compliant vault.
    *   💰 Allows deposits/withdrawals of USDC (liquidity provision).
*   **Integration:** Inherits from Socket's `PlugBase`.
    *   🔌 Connects to Socket's infrastructure.
    *   🛡️ Uses `onlySocket` modifier: Ensures only verified payloads from Socket can trigger fund usage.
*   **Core Function:** `executeIntent(RelayData)` – Calls Across's SpokePool to fulfill the bridge using vault liquidity.

#### 2. **Filler Strategy (Off-Chain - Socket/EVMX)**
*   **Base Contract:** Inherits from Socket's `UpGatewayBase`.
    *   🔄 Handles asynchronous flows and virtual address (forward address) creation for the linked vault.
*   **Functions:**
    *   **Deploy Vault:** Prepares and triggers on-chain deployment of the linked Filler Vault via Socket.
    *   **Process Intent:**
        *   📡 Listens for intent events (via Across SpokePool) on the source chain (Arbitrum Sepolia).
        *   ✅ Filters intents (e.g., only USDC Arbitrum Sepolia → Optimism Sepolia).
        *   ⏱️ Applies configurable `fillDelay` (e.g., 2s aggressive, 30s conservative).
        *   📦 Prepares a payload to call `executeIntent` on the *on-chain vault*.
        *   📤 Sends payload to Socket's transmitters for on-chain verification and execution.

#### 3. **Executor.sol (On-Chain - Optimism Sepolia)**
*   **Role:** Acts as the **exclusive relayer** specified in the Across intent.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Vault transfers the required output USDC amount to `Executor.sol`.
    2.  Vault calls `executeIntent` on `Executor.sol`.
    3.  `Executor.sol` approves the SpokePool and calls `fillRelay`.

### 🔄 End-to-End Flow
1.  **User Action:** Deposits USDC into Across SpokePool on Arbitrum Sepolia.
2.  **Intent Auction:** Across emits an intent event.
3.  **Strategy Detection:** Off-chain Filler Strategy (on Socket) listens for the event.
4.  **Strategy Evaluation:** Strategy checks if intent matches its criteria (token, route).
5.  **Payload Creation:** Strategy prepares a payload to call `executeIntent` on the Filler Vault.
6.  **Transmission:** Payload sent to Socket's off-chain transmitters.
7.  **On-Chain Verification:** Transmitters submit payload to Socket's on-chain contract (`Socket`), which routes it to the configured `Switchboard` (e.g., Fast Switchboard for attestation).
8.  **Verification & Execution:** If verification passes, `Socket` contract calls `executeIntent` on the Filler Vault.
9.  **Vault Action:** Vault uses its USDC liquidity to fulfill the intent via `Executor.sol` -> Across SpokePool on Optimism Sepolia.
10. **Completion:** User receives USDC on Optimism Sepolia.

## 🧪 MVP Deployment & Demonstration

### 📋 Prerequisites
*   Deploy `Executor.sol` (destination chain).
*   Deploy Filler Strategies on Socket (2 strategies: aggressive 2s, conservative 30s delay).
*   Deposit fees into Socket's `Fees Plug` for transmitter compensation.
*   Deploy Filler Vaults *on-chain* via the Filler Strategy contracts.
*   Deploy `SpokePoolWrapper` on source chain (workaround for Socket event listening).
*   Configure environment variables with deployed contract addresses (obtained via script).
*   Fund Filler Vaults with USDC.

### 👁️ Visual Demonstration (Frontend)
*   **Interface:** Shows two Filler Vaults (Aggressive, Conservative) with TVL and Fees Earned.
*   **Test 1 (Small Amount):**
    *   Action: Bridge 0.02 USDC.
    *   Result: **Aggressive Vault** fills the intent quickly.
    *   Outcome: Vault TVL decreases (liquidity used), Fees Earned increases.
*   **Test 2 (Large Amount):**
    *   Action: Bridge 0.06 USDC.
    *   Result: Aggressive Vault attempts but lacks funds. **Conservative Vault** fills after its 30s delay.
    *   Outcome: Conservative Vault TVL decreases, Fees Earned increases.

### 📊 Fee & Liquidity Mechanics (Example)
*   **Scenario:** Vault funded with 0.04 USDC. User bridges 0.02 USDC (input) -> receives 0.01 USDC (output).
    *   **Fee:** 0.02 (input) - 0.01 (output) = 0.01 USDC (earned by vault).
    *   **TVL Change:** 0.04 -> 0.03 USDC (0.01 USDC liquidity used).
    *   **Post-Across Settlement:** Vault receives the 0.02 USDC input, TVL increases to 0.03 + 0.02 = 0.05 USDC.
