# 🚀 Embedded Wallets: Self-Custody Without Private Keys

---

## 🎯 The New Era of Blockchain Onboarding

* "We are not in the early days of crypto anymore… we are in the early days of crypto being usable." – Vitalik Buterin
* Traditional onboarding:

  * Required external wallet setup (e.g., MetaMask).
  * Users had to manage complex **private keys**.
* Embedded wallets simplify access:

  * Login with familiar methods ✅ Google, Email, SMS.
  * No separate wallet setup needed.
  * Removes complexity of key management.

---

## 🔑 What is an Embedded Wallet?

* **Definition**: A wallet built directly into an application (not a separate app).
* **Under the hood**:

  * Still a public-private key pair 🔐.
  * But private key management is invisible to the user.
* **Core Benefit**:

  * Users enjoy **self-custody** while avoiding the hassle of private key storage.

---

## 💡 How Embedded Wallets Work

1. User signs up via Google, Email, or OTP.
2. Application automatically creates an embedded wallet.
3. Wallet code is integrated into the app (not external like MetaMask).
4. Transactions are signed under the hood — user never sees or touches private keys.

---

## 🧩 Cryptography Behind the Magic

* **Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS)**

  * Splits a private key into multiple shares.
  * Only a threshold number of shares needed to reconstruct the key.
  * Example: 3 shares → any 2 can rebuild the key.
* ✅ Ensures no single entity ever controls the full key.

---

## 🔒 Example: Privy’s Model

* **3 Shares in Use**

  * Device Share → stored locally in browser.
  * Auth Share → stored on Privy’s servers, released upon login.
  * Recovery Share → backup for new devices.
* **Process**:

  * User action (swap/send) → app requests signature.
  * SDK sends request to **isolated iframe** (sandboxed environment).
  * Two shares combined → private key reconstructed in memory.
  * Key erased instantly after signing.
  * Transaction broadcast to blockchain.

---

## 🖥️ Security Architecture: Isolated Iframe

* Runs on a separate domain.
* Acts as a sandbox 🔒.
* Application cannot access iframe memory.
* Private key only exists temporarily, then erased.
* ✅ Prevents both app and provider from seeing private key.

---

## 📱 Recovery Flow (New Device Login)

* Device share unavailable → recovery share used.
* Recovery share is encrypted on Privy servers.
* Two options for users:

  1. **Provider-managed encryption** → convenient but adds trust risk.
  2. **User-managed encryption** → stronger self-custody (password or cloud secret).

---

## 📊 Pros of Embedded Wallets

* ✅ **Enhanced Security**: No entity sees full private key.
* ✅ **User Convenience**: Familiar logins, instant onboarding.
* ✅ **Preserves Self-Custody**: Users control assets.
* ✅ **Frictionless UX**: Perfect for onboarding non-crypto natives.

---

## ⚠️ Trade-offs & Risks

* ❌ **Lack of Awareness**: Users may never learn about private keys.
* ❌ **Provider Dependency**: Downtime = temporary lockout.
* ❌ **App Lock-in**: Wallet tied to a single app (unlike MetaMask).
* ❌ **Education Gap**: Users may misunderstand recovery limitations.

---

## 📈 Use Cases & Applications

* Seamless onboarding for Web3 apps (gaming, social, marketplaces).
* Enterprises offering blockchain features without requiring crypto knowledge.
* DeFi apps lowering entry barriers for mainstream users.
* Mobile-first blockchain adoption 🌍📱.

---

## 💡 Best Practices for Adoption

* Educate users on recovery & self-custody spectrum.
* Offer **export option** for private keys → full self-custody fallback.
* Maintain high uptime & redundancy for provider services.
* Combine with **progressive disclosure** UX → gradually teach users blockchain principles.

---

## 🔮 The Bigger Picture

* Embedded wallets = bridge between Web2 familiarity & Web3 empowerment.
* Critical for scaling blockchain adoption beyond crypto natives.
* Balance of **security 🔐, usability 🎯, and decentralization 🌐**.

# **Embedded Wallets: Self-Custody Without Private Keys**  
🎯 **On-chain UX in the post-crypto-early-days era**

## **H1. The New Onboarding Reality**  
📊 *“We are no longer in the early days of crypto; we are in the early days of crypto being usable.”*  
– Vitalik Buterin, 2024  

### **Why It Matters**  
- **Traditional drop-off**: 70-90 % of new users abandon dApps at wallet-creation step (MetaMask, Ledger, etc.).  
- **Embedded wallets** convert >60 % of those users by removing friction.

---

## **H1. What Is an Embedded Wallet?**  
💡 **Definition**  
A wallet whose code is **baked into the dApp** instead of being a separate browser extension or hardware device.

| Classic Wallet | Embedded Wallet |
| --- | --- |
| MetaMask, Phantom | Privy, Dynamic, Web3Auth |
| User manages keys | Keys generated & stored behind the scenes |
| Universal across dApps | Locked to one application |

---

## **H1. Core Value Props**  
✅ **Instant Access** – 1-click Google / e-mail / SMS login  
✅ **Invisible Complexity** – no seed phrases, no browser extensions  
✅ **True Self-Custody** – provider **never** holds full private key  

---

## **H1. Under the Hood: Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS)**  
📐 **Concept**  
Split a secret (private key) into *n* pieces where *k* pieces are enough to reconstruct it.  

- **n = 3 shares**  
- **k = 2 threshold**

### **The Three Shares**  
1. **Device Share** 🔐 – stored in browser local storage  
2. **Auth Share** 🔑 – kept by Privy; released after OAuth / OTP  
3. **Recovery Share** 🔄 – encrypted & stored by user (cloud or password)

---

## **H1. Transaction Flow: First Device**  
🎯 **Step-by-Step**

1. **User swaps tokens** → dApp requests signature  
2. **dApp calls Privy SDK**  
3. **Isolated iframe loads** (separate domain, sandboxed)  
4. **iframe fetches**  
   - Device share (local storage)  
   - Auth share (Privy API)  
5. **Reconstruct private key in iframe memory**  
6. **Sign transaction**  
7. **Key wiped from memory** 🔥  

---

## **H1. Transaction Flow: New Device**  
🔄 **Recovery Path**

- **Device share missing** → trigger recovery  
- **Retrieve encrypted recovery share**  
  - Option A: **Privy-hosted encryption** (convenient, slight trust)  
  - Option B: **User-controlled encryption** (password or cloud backup)  
- **Decrypt locally** → combine with auth share → sign

---

## **H1. Security Architecture**  
🔒 **Zero-Knowledge Orchestration**

| Attack Vector | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Provider breach | Never holds 2-of-3 shares |
| Malicious dApp | iframe isolated domain + CSP |
| XSS on dApp | iframe memory inaccessible |
| Server downtime | Exportable full private key anytime |

---

## **H1. Pros vs. Cons at a Glance**

| **Pros** | **Cons** |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ 5-second onboarding | ❌ Tied to single dApp |
| ✅ No seed phrase risk | ❌ Relies on provider uptime |
| ✅ Exportable keys for full self-custody | ❌ Users may never learn crypto basics |

---

## **H1. Best-Practice Checklist for Builders**  
📋 **Integration**

- [ ] **Educate users** with 30-second explainer modal  
- [ ] **Offer export** “Download private key” button  
- [ ] **Enable user-controlled recovery** by default for >$1 k wallets  
- [ ] **Monitor iframe CSP** & domain isolation quarterly  

---

## **H1. When to Choose Embedded vs. Classic Wallets**

| Scenario | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| Consumer NFT drop (10 k users) | Embedded |
| DeFi power users (>5 tx/day) | MetaMask + WalletConnect |
| Institutional treasury | MPC custody (Fireblocks) |
| Mobile-first game | Embedded (React Native SDK) |

---

## **H1. Market Snapshot 2024**  
📊 **Providers & Traction**

- **Privy** – 1.2 M wallets created, 250+ dApps  
- **Dynamic** – 600 k wallets, Shopify plugin live  
- **Web3Auth** – 700 k wallets, multi-chain SSS + MPC hybrid  

---

## **H1. Future Roadmap**  
🔮 **Emerging Features**

- **Cross-app portability** (EIP-7521 wallet switching)  
- **Account abstraction (ERC-4337)** + embedded wallets  
- **On-device secure enclave** storage for device share (iOS Keychain, Android Keystore)

---

## **H1. Key Takeaway**  
🚀 Embedded wallets **bridge Web2 UX to Web3 sovereignty**, but builders must **balance convenience with education** to avoid a generation of users who own crypto without understanding custody.
