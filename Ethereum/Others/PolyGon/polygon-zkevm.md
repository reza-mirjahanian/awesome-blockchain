### Polygon zkEVM
 is the leading zero knowledge scaling solution thatâ€™s equivalent with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, this means that most of the existing smart contracts, developer tools, and wallets work seamlessly.  
  
Polygon zkEVM harnesses the power of ZK proofs to reduce transaction cost and increase throughput, all while inheriting the security of Ethereum L1.


1- Ethereum-equivalence: Most Ethereum smart contracts, wallets, tools, etc. work on Polygon zkEVM seamlessly.  
2- Inherits Ethereum security  
3- Lower cost compared to L1 and better finality than other L2 solutions like Optimistic Rollups  
4- ZKP-powered scalability, and aiming at similar throughput to PoS


The ultimate goal is not compatibility. The ultimate goal is equivalence. Solutions that are compatible enable most of existing apps to work, but sometimes with code changes. Additionally, compatibility may lead to the breaking of developer tooling. Polygon zkEVM strives for EVM Equivalence, because it means that most applications, tools and infrastructure built on Ethereum can immediately port over to Polygon zkEVM with limited to no changes needed. Things are designed to work 100% on day one. This is important, because ideally:  
1. Development teams don't have to make changes to their code, which could introduce a security vulnerability  
2. Since no code changes are needed, you dont need additional audits, which saves teams money  
3. The experience for a developer is much better. Since he/she is not rewriting the application, valuable time is saved.  
4. The solution ultimately benefits from the security and decentralization of Ethereum, since transactions are still finalising on Ethereum  
5. Allows Polygon zkEVM to benefit from the already vibrant and active Ethereum community  
6. Allows for significant and quick dApp adoption, since apps built on Ethereum today are designed to be compatible.
