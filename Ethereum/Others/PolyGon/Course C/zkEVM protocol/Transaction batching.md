Transaction batching
====================
The trusted sequencer must batch the transactions using the following `BatchData` struct specified in the `PolygonZkEVM.sol` contract:

```
`struct BatchData {
  bytes transactions;
  bytes32 globalExitRoot;
  uint64 timestamp;
  uint64 minForcedTimestamp;
}`
```


### Transactions

​These are byte arrays containing the concatenated batch transactions.

​Each transaction is encoded according to the Ethereum pre-EIP-155 or EIP-155 formats using RLP (recursive-length prefix) standard, together with the signature values,  `v`,  `r`  and  `s`, concatenated as shown below;

1.  `EIP-155`:  rlp(nonce,gasprice,gasLimit,to,value,data,chainid,0,0,)#v#r#s#effectivePercentage
    
2.  `pre-EIP-155`:  rlp(nonce,gasprice,gasLimit,to,value,data)#v#r#s#effectivePercentage
    

### GlobalExitRoot

The root of the bridge’s global exit Merkle tree, called  `GlobalExitRoot`, is synchronized in the L2 state at the start of batch execution.

The bridge transports assets between L1 and L2, and a claiming transaction unlocks the asset in the destination network.

### Timestamp

​In as much as Ethereum blocks have timestamps, and since the Etrog upgrade, each block has its own timestamp.

​There are two constraints each timestamp must satisfy in order to ensure that blocks are ordered in time and synchronized with L1 blocks:

1.  The timestamp of a given block must be greater or equal to the timestamp of the last block (in a sequenced batch).
    
2.  The maximum block timestamp a trusted sequencer can set to a block is the timestamp of the block where the sequencing L1 transaction is executed.
    

### MinForcedTimestamp

If a batch is a so-called forced batch, the  `MinForcedTimestamp`  parameter must be greater than zero. Censorship is mitigated by utilizing forced batches. Further details on this is provided in the following sections.
