### Understanding zkRollups and zkSNARKs



#### What is zkRollup?

Before diving into zkRollups, we need to understand the different types of zk protocols. 

- **What is zk?**
  - We start with ZKP, which stands for Zero Knowledge Proof. 
  - Zero Knowledge Proofs have been a part of cryptography since the 1980s. It is not exclusive to blockchain but is a fundamental cryptographic principle used in various ways.

In the context of cryptography, ZKP has two main applications in the crypto space: 

- **zkSNARKs**
  - **Function**: Privacy
  - **Example**: Privacy coins like Zcoin and Zcash use zkSNARKs.

- **zkRollups**
  - **Function**: Scalability
  - **Application**: zkRollups are used in layer 2 solutions to enhance scalability.

#### Layer 1 vs. Layer 2

- **Layer 1**:
  - Base layer of the blockchain.
  - Think of it as a regular road where cars (transactions) go from point A to point B.

- **Layer 2**:
  - Scalability layer built on top of layer 1.
  - Analogous to a highway, allowing more cars (transactions) to travel efficiently.

**Layer 1 and Layer 2 Comparison**:
- **Layer 1**:
  - Base layer with privacy features (e.g., zkSNARKs).
  
- **Layer 2**:
  - Scalability layer using zkRollups for higher transaction throughput.

### What are zkRollups?

To understand zkRollups, letâ€™s use the analogy of roads and cars:

- **State 1**: Transactions are approved, verified, and validated.
- **State 2**: New transactions are validated and approved.

**Transition from State 1 to State 2**:
- Each road represents a transaction path.
- Cars carry transaction packets (e.g., Uniswap, Compound, Aave transactions) and move from state 1 to state 2, paying transaction fees.

**Improvement with zkRollups**:
- Instead of using cars, use a plane to carry multiple passengers (transactions) at once.
- This method is more efficient and cost-effective as the fee is shared among many transactions.

### Application of zkRollups

**Smart Contract Analogy**:
- **Block 1**: Initial transactions.
- **Block 2**: Aggregated transactions from layer 2.

**Layer 2 Off-Chain Computation**:
- Transactions within layer 2 are free until they need to update the main blockchain.
- Example: Person A and Person B transacting within layer 2 and consolidating at the end of the month.

### zkRollups in Practice

**Technology Behind zkRollups**:
- **Merkle Tree**: A data structure used for verifying and aggregating transactions.

### Projects Using zkRollups

**Layer 2 Projects**:
- **Loopring**
- **Plasma Chain**
- **zkSync**

**Other Layer 2 Solutions**:
- **Sharding**: Distributing transactions to enhance scalability (e.g., Lightning Network).

### Verification in Off-Chain Computation

**Key Technologies**:
- **Verification**: Ensuring transactions are accurate.
- **Accounting**: Managing tokens.
- **Transactions**: Keeping track of blockchain activities.
