**Why Care About ZK Proofs?**
- Extremely complex mathematics
- Previously niche, now gaining mainstream attention due to zk-EVMs
- Vitalik Buterin: ZK snarks are as important as blockchain technology
- Speaker's opinion: ZK is bigger than blockchain

**Historical Context**
- Comparison to the invention of algebra
- ZK proofs: A new field of mathematics with far-reaching implications

**What is a ZK Proof?**
- New type of cryptography
- Prover can prove a statement is true to a verifier without revealing additional information

**How ZK Proofs Work**
1. "Where's Waldo?" example
2. Sudoku example
3. Passport expiration example

**Creating a ZK Proof**
- Involves public inputs, private inputs, and a relational circuit
- Abstraction of complexity (comparison to operating systems)

**Types of ZK Proofs**
- SNARKs vs. STARKs
  - SNARKs: Cheaper to verify on-chain, less secure
  - STARKs: More secure, more expensive to verify on-chain

**Applications of ZK Proofs**

1. **Verifiable Computation**
   - Reduces redundant computation in blockchain networks
   - Example: Bitcoin with one node maintaining security

2. **Scaling Blockchains**
   - Current blockchain limitations
   - ZK scaling potential:
     - Ethereum: 15-30 TPS
     - With ZK L2: 300-3,000 TPS
     - With proto-danksharding: 3,000-60,000 TPS
     - Potential for fractal scaling (L3, L4, etc.)

3. **Interoperability**
   - ZK-based bridges between blockchains
   - Hyper bridges in fractal ZK systems
   - Pseudo-atomic composability

4. **Identity and Privacy**
   - Selective disclosure of personal information
   - Examples:
     - Age verification
     - Citizenship proof
     - NFT ownership proof
   - KYC improvements

5. **Improved Security**
   - Password-less authentication
   - Private blockchains and mixers

6. **Understanding Our World**
   - Potential applications in various fields:
     - Photo authenticity verification
     - Cloud storage proofs
     - Computer optimization
     - Machine learning efficiency
     - Understanding black holes
     - Quantum entanglement theory

**Conclusion**
- ZK proofs will affect the world significantly
- Worth paying attention to, regardless of one's interest in mathematics
