### Native Rollup Verification Approaches
![alt text](image.png)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Problem with Current Rollups

### üîß Key Issues
1. **Complex Custom Verification**  
   - Thousands of lines of fraud-proof logic or SNARK verifiers  
   - High vulnerability risk

2. **Proving Circuit Vulnerabilities**  
   - Incorrect opcode implementations can falsely validate state transitions

3. **Centralized Fallbacks**  
   - Reliance on security councils and centralized sequencers

4. **Manual EVM Upgrades**  
   - Requires governance intervention  
   - Breaks true EVM equivalence

5. **Expensive Onchain Verification**  
   - High costs force infrequent settlement

# What are Native Rollups?

Native Rollups use Ethereum's native execution engine directly

## The EXECUTE Precompile:

- ‚Üí Exposes Ethereum's built-in EVM execution engine to rollups  
- ‚Üí Rollups call precompile with transaction traces instead of building custom verification  
- ‚Üí Ethereum validators re-execute or verify proofs offchain using diverse zkEL clients  

## Key Benefits:

- ‚Üí Eliminates complex custom verification systems  
- ‚Üí Enables trustless rollups through L1 security inheritance  
- ‚Üí Cost benefits from batching efficiencies, not computational efficiency

# EXECUTE Precompile

## Function Specification
`EXECUTE(pre_state_root, post_state_root, trace, gas_used) ‚Üí boolean`

## Validation Process
1. Process `trace` from `pre_state_root`
2. Confirm execution produces exact `post_state_root`
3. Verify precise gas consumption

## Resource Management
- EIP-1559-style metering of cumulative gas across all `EXECUTE` calls
- `EXECUTE_CUMULATIVE_GAS_LIMIT` prevents denial-of-service (DOS) attacks
- Batching multiple `EXECUTE` calls for efficiency


# <span style="color:#2E86C1">Stateless Verification</span>

## <span style="color:#28B463">Core Concept</span>
- Verifiers confirm state transitions **without storing full blockchain state**
- Use **state access proofs** (Merkle proofs) to reconstruct needed state data
- Shift validation from **storage-intensive** to **computation-focused**

---

## <span style="color:#F39C12">Rollup Implications</span>

### 1. <span style="color:#5DADE2">Vanilla ‚Äì Re-execution</span>
- Verifiers temporarily hold complete execution traces  
- Blob data only sampled via **Data Availability (DA)**
- Use trace to **re-execute computation directly**

### 2. <span style="color:#AF7AC5">Phys/Zero-Knowledge ‚Äì SNARK verification</span>
- Use trace to verify formatting
- Rely on **cryptographic proofs** for correctness

### 3. <span style="color:#E74C3C">Tradeoff</span>
- ~10√ó DA overhead vs current optimistic rollups

------------

# <span style="color:#2E86C1">Verification Approaches</span>

## <span style="color:#28B463">Phase 1: Re-execution (Launch)</span>
- Validators directly rerun transactions using provided trace  
- Simple but **computationally intensive**  
- Limited by validator resources

---

## <span style="color:#F39C12">Phase 2: SNARK Verification (Long-term)</span>
- Validators verify **compact mathematical proofs**  
- Enables **higher throughput**  
- Reduces computational overhead

---

## <span style="color:#AF7AC5">ZK Architecture</span>
- No standardized format: Each validator uses preferred ZK system (e.g., Succinct, Risc0)  
- Multiple proofs: Same trace may require different formats for different zkE clients  
- Consensus standardizes **state access proof format only**, not ZK implementation

## üåê Rollup Comparison: Optimistic vs ZK Native

| Feature       | Optimistic Native Rollups                                                                 | ZK Native Rollups                                                                 |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Availability (DA)** | - Normally cheap (Alt-DA possible)  <br> - Ethereum DA only during disputes                  | - All data on Ethereum  <br> - Validators need immediate access                   |
| **Batches**   | - Arbitrarily large  <br> - `EXECUTE` verifies disputed segments only                      | - Constrained by `EXECUTE_CUMULATIVE_GAS_LIMIT`                                   |
| **Finality**  | - Challenge period delays                                                                 | - Real-time settlement  <br> - One-slot delayed execution                         |
| **Economics** | *(Not specified)*                                                                         | - ZK often more economical due to capital efficiency gains from fast finality     |



## ‚öôÔ∏è Current Ethereum Consensus Limitations

### üßë‚Äçüíª Current Roles
- **Proposers**
  - Handle consensus and execution
  - Receive all rewards
- **Attesters**
  - Vote on block validity for finalization

---

### üöß Problems
- Single proposer must do both jobs in a 12-second slot
- Insufficient time for complex cryptographic operations
- PBS (Proposer-Builder Separation) helps but doesn‚Äôt solve timing constraints

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è Need
- Separate timing for consensus vs execution work


### Attester-Proposer Separation (APS)

## üß± Role & Timing Structure in Decentralized Protocols

### üîÑ Role Separation
- ‚ûî **Beacon proposers**:  
  - Handle consensus only  
  - Receive beacon rewards  
  - Selected by protocol

- ‚ûî **Execution proposers**:  
  - Handle block execution  
  - Receive execution rewards  
  - Determined by market

- ‚ûî **Builders**:  
  - Construct blocks  
  - Compatible with both proposer roles

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è Timing Structure
- ‚ûî **Slot N**: Beacon proposer handles consensus
- ‚ûî **Slot N+1**: Execution proposer handles execution for Slot N

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical for Native Rollups
- Execution proposers get full 12 seconds for SNARK generation  
  *(instead of just milliseconds)*

---

### üß© Compatibility Note
- APS and PBS are **compatible**, not mutually exclusive

----

## ‚è≥ Delayed Execution & Proof Generation

### üïí 1. Delayed Execution
- Validators approve blocks *before* executing transactions  
- Makes Ethereum **5√ó faster**  
- Maintains security via **economic incentives**

---

### üîÅ 2. One-Slot Delayed Proofs
- Block executed in **Slot N**, proof generated in **Slot N+1**  
- Attesters attest to **Slot N+1** only if proofs exist for **Slot N**

---

### ‚ö° 3. Same-Slot Proof Solution (Latest)
- Builders prove their own blocks to claim rewards  
- If proofs are missing ‚Üí automatic **‚Äúno-op‚Äù execution**  
  *(pre-state carries forward)*
- Eliminates altruistic prover 
dependencies
