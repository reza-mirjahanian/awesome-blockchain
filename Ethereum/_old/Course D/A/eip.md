### **1. EIP-20: ERC-20 Token Standard**
- **Purpose**: Defines a standard interface for fungible tokens on Ethereum.
- **Significance**:
  - ERC-20 tokens are the most widely used token standard on Ethereum.
  - They allow for the creation of fungible tokens, meaning each token is identical in type and value (e.g., stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and governance tokens).
  - Standardizes token behavior, making them compatible with wallets, exchanges, and decentralized applications (dApps).
- **Key Features**:
  - Functions like `transfer`, `approve`, `transferFrom`, and `balanceOf` ensure interoperability.
  - Enables smart contracts to interact with tokens in a predictable way.

### **2. EIP-721: ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Standard**
- **Purpose**: Introduced a standard for creating **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**.
- **Significance**:
  - ERC-721 tokens are unique and indivisible, unlike ERC-20 tokens.
  - This standard powers the NFT ecosystem, enabling digital ownership of assets like art, collectibles, music, and more.
  - Used by platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, and Axie Infinity.
- **Key Features**:
  - Each token has a unique `tokenId` and metadata that distinguishes it from others.
  - Supports ownership transfer and approval mechanisms.

### **3. EIP-1559: Fee Market Reform**
- **Purpose**: Introduced a new transaction fee mechanism to improve user experience and make Ethereum's fee structure more predictable.
- **Significance**:
  - Introduced in the **London Hard Fork** (August 2021).
  - Replaced the auction-based gas fee model with a **base fee** and **priority fee (tip)**.
  - The base fee is burned (removed from circulation), introducing a **deflationary mechanism** for Ether.
  - Improved fee predictability and reduced overpayment for transactions.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Base Fee**: Automatically adjusted based on network demand.
  - **Priority Fee**: Users can add a tip to incentivize faster transaction processing.

### **4. EIP-137: Ethereum Name Service (ENS)**
- **Purpose**: Defines a standard for mapping human-readable names to Ethereum addresses.
- **Significance**:
  - Simplifies the user experience by allowing users to send and receive funds using names like `alice.eth` instead of long hexadecimal addresses.
  - Widely adopted in the Ethereum ecosystem and integrated into wallets like MetaMask.
- **Key Features**:
  - Supports mapping names to not just Ethereum addresses but also content hashes, metadata, and other resources.
  - Enhances interoperability and usability across dApps.

---

### **5. EIP-7212: ERC-1155 Multi-Token Standard**
- **Purpose**: A standard for creating both fungible and non-fungible tokens in a single contract.
- **Significance**:
  - Used in gaming and collectibles platforms where both fungible (e.g., in-game currency) and non-fungible (e.g., rare items) assets are needed.
  - More efficient than ERC-20 or ERC-721 for managing multiple token types.
- **Key Features**:
  - Reduces gas costs by allowing batch transfers of multiple tokens.
  - Supports fungible, non-fungible, and semi-fungible tokens.

---

### **6. EIP-1: The First Ethereum Improvement Proposal**
- **Purpose**: Established the process for proposing and discussing changes to Ethereum.
- **Significance**:
  - Created the foundation for the EIP process, ensuring transparency and community involvement in Ethereumâ€™s development.
  - Defined the structure and guidelines for submitting EIPs.
- **Key Features**:
  - Acts as a "meta" EIP, providing instructions for how to propose new EIPs.

---

### **7. EIP-1014: CREATE2 Opcode**
- **Purpose**: Introduced the `CREATE2` opcode, allowing smart contracts to be deployed at deterministic addresses.
- **Significance**:
  - Enables the creation of contracts whose addresses can be predicted before deployment.
  - Widely used in Layer 2 scaling solutions, such as state channels and rollups.
  - Enhances functionality for applications requiring pre-determined contract addresses.
- **Key Features**:
  - Supports better upgradeability and contract interactions.

---

### **8. EIP-1822: Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard (UUPS)**
- **Purpose**: Provides a standard for creating upgradeable smart contracts.
- **Significance**:
  - Upgradeable contracts are essential for dApps that need to adapt to changing requirements or fix bugs.
  - UUPS is a widely used proxy pattern for implementing upgradeability.
- **Key Features**:
  - Separates logic and storage into different contracts.
  - Reduces gas costs compared to older proxy patterns like the Transparent Proxy.

---

### **9. EIP-101: Serenity (Ethereum 2.0)**
- **Purpose**: Outlined the transition of Ethereum from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS).
- **Significance**:
  - Laid the groundwork for Ethereum 2.0, which aims to improve scalability, security, and energy efficiency.
  - Introduced key concepts like the Beacon Chain, sharding, and validator staking.
- **Key Features**:
  - Introduced staking as a replacement for mining.
  - Paved the way for future scalability solutions like sharding.

---

### **10. EIP-1967: Proxy Storage Slots**
- **Purpose**: Standardized storage layout for proxy contracts.
- **Significance**:
  - Simplifies the development of upgradeable contracts by defining where proxy-related data should be stored.
  - Ensures compatibility across different implementations.
- **Key Features**:
  - Defines specific storage slots for proxy-related data, reducing the risk of storage collisions.

---

### **11. EIP-2930: Access List Transactions**
- **Purpose**: Introduced a new transaction type with an **access list** to optimize gas costs.
- **Significance**:
  - Part of the **Berlin Hard Fork** (April 2021).
  - Reduces gas costs for transactions that access multiple storage slots or contracts.
  - Improves efficiency for dApps and Layer 2 solutions.
- **Key Features**:
  - Allows users to specify storage slots and contracts they intend to access in advance.

---

### **12. EIP-4844: Proto-Danksharding**
- **Purpose**: Proposes a new transaction type for **data blobs**, paving the way for full sharding in Ethereum 2.0.
- **Significance**:
  - Aims to reduce the cost of Layer 2 rollups by introducing cheaper data availability.
  - Improves scalability without compromising security.
- **Key Features**:
  - Introduces **data blobs** that are not directly accessible to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
  - Reduces gas fees for Layer 2 transactions.

### **13. EIP-2535: Diamond Standard**
- **Purpose**: A standard for modular smart contract systems.
- **Significance**:
  - Allows developers to create contracts with multiple facets (modular components).
  - Supports complex dApps that require extensive functionality without exceeding contract size limits.
- **Key Features**:
  - Enables dynamic upgrades and additions to smart contract functionality.
  - Reduces gas costs by splitting logic into smaller components.
