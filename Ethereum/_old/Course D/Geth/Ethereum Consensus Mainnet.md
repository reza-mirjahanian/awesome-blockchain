[Become an Ethereum Consensus Mainnet Validator](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/mainnet-validator.html#become-an-ethereum-consensus-mainnet-validator)
=============================================================================================================================================================

Becoming an Ethereum consensus validator is rewarding, but it's not for the faint of heart. You'll need to be familiar with the rules of staking (e.g., rewards, penalties, etc.) and also configuring and managing servers. You'll also need at least 32 ETH!

Being educated is critical to a validator's success. Before submitting your mainnet deposit, we recommend:

-   Thoroughly exploring the [Staking Launchpad](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/) website, try running through the deposit process using a testnet launchpad such as the [Holesky staking launchpad](https://holesky.launchpad.ethereum.org/en/).
-   Running a testnet validator.
-   Reading through this documentation, especially the [Slashing Protection](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/slashing-protection.html) section.
-   Performing a web search and doing your own research.
