# 📚 Blockchain Virtual Machines (VMs)

* **Definition**: Replicated State Machine

  * Start with one state → Transition to another via **State Transition Function**
  * Each block = state transition
* **Analogy**:

  * *Class* = Virtual Machine
  * *Instance* = Blockchain (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet, Avalanche C-Chain, Subnet EVM)
* **Layers of Abstraction**:

  * 🌐 **Network / Consensus Layer** → Ensures nodes agree on execution
  * ⚙️ **Execution Layer** → Defines how state transitions occur
  * 📦 **Application Layer** → Where developers deploy dApps (Solidity, Rust, Move, etc.)

# 🔧 Why Customize the EVM?

* Standard EVM = Limited by Solidity
* Issues:

  * High gas cost for complex computation
  * Lack of libraries (e.g., cryptography, ML)
* **Solution: Precompiles**

  * Native functions at VM level, accessed via Solidity interface
  * Provide **performance**, **security**, **interoperability**

---

# ⚡ Precompiles (Non-Stateful)

* **Concept**:

  * Native Go code wrapped with Solidity interface
  * Acts as a **shortcut** inside VM, not deployed bytecode
* **Benefits**:

  * ✅ Efficient gas usage
  * ✅ Use of existing libraries (Go, Rust)
  * ✅ Security (battle-tested crypto implementations)
* **Example**:

  * SHA-256 (`0x02` reserved precompile address)
  * Cryptographic primitives (ECDSA recovery, BLS, etc.)
* **Interaction**:

  * Import Solidity interface
  * Call like a normal contract function

---

# 🗂️ Gas Customization in Precompiles

* Not limited to opcode gas rules
* VM designers can **set custom gas costs**
* Example:

  * Define lower gas for hashing function than Solidity equivalent
* Result:

  * Faster execution
  * Reduced cost for developers & users

---

# 🛠️ Stateful Precompiles

* **Extension of Precompiles**:

  * Can **read/write blockchain state** (not just compute)
* **Risks**:

  * Direct access to blockchain database
  * Requires **network upgrade** or **custom chain**
* **Key Elements**:

  * `Run` function + `PrecompileAccessibleState`
  * Can modify key-value pairs of state DB
* **Gas Model**:

  * Similar to contracts (gas supplied & consumed)

---

# 🌍 Use Cases for Stateful Precompiles

* **Allowlist / Permissioned Chains**

  * Restrict who can deploy contracts
  * Useful for institutional/private chains
* **Native Token Minter**

  * Mint bridged assets as **native gas token** (e.g., USDC)
  * Useful for **cross-chain dApps**
* **Dynamic Fee Configuration**

  * Smart contract-controlled gas fees
  * Example: Adjust **minimum gas price** without network upgrade

---

# 🧩 How to Deploy Precompiles

* **Genesis Block Configuration**

  * Define which precompiles activate at chain start
* **Upgrade Activation**

  * Precompiles can also be added during network upgrade
* **Steps**:

  1. Clone Precompile VM repo 🛠️
  2. Define Solidity interface
  3. Use `generate-precompile.sh` for boilerplate
  4. Implement Go logic (crypto, ZK proofs, etc.)
  5. Register precompile address (avoid conflicts with reserved ones)
  6. Build & launch VM with new chain

---

# 🚀 Developer Workflow & Tools

* **Solidity Interface**

  * Bridge between contracts & precompile
* **Go Libraries**

  * Import existing battle-tested libraries
* **Precompile VM (Avalanche Academy)**

  * Simplifies setup by abstracting subnet complexity
* **Testing**:

  * Deploy local subnet
  * Run calls to verify behavior
  * Monitor gas & state changes

---

# 🔐 Security & Interoperability Benefits

* **Security**

  * Reuse audited cryptographic libraries
  * Avoid Solidity’s implementation flaws
* **Interoperability**

  * Enable communication between **non-EVM chains**
  * Example: Cross-chain messaging in Avalanche Warp

---

# 💡 Hackathon & Innovation Examples

* zk-SNARK & zk-STARK verifiers via precompiles
* Cryptographic hashing & signature verification
* Custom stateful logic for **NFT marketplaces**
* Permissioned DeFi chains for compliance
