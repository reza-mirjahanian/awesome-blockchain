# What is Precompile in zkVM? üöÄ

- **Definition**: Precompiles are special-purpose circuit tables designed for proving one or a few cryptographic operations, such as hashing or elliptic curve pairing.
  - They handle cryptographic computations in dedicated circuits or tables *outside* the main CPU tables.
  - This avoids transforming complex cryptographic logic into MIPS instructions, which can be inefficient.
- **Performance Benefits** üí®:
  - Precompiles bring **significant improvements** in proof generation for cryptographic ops.
  - Example: Running SHA-256 precompile on zkMIPS reduced costs by ~40% and proofing time by half üìâ.
- **Related Concepts**:
  - In zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), precompiles optimize for operations that are computationally intensive in general-purpose circuits.
  - Similar to Ethereum's precompiles (e.g., for ECDSA recovery), which offload ops to native code for gas efficiency.
  -Think of precompiles as "shortcut circuits" ‚ö° to bypass slow instruction-by-instruction proving.

# How to Use Precompile in zkMIPS? üõ†Ô∏è

- **Integration Method**: Precompiles are provided as system calls, executed via MIPS syscall instructions.
  - Supported syscalls include cryptographic hash functions like Keccak-256 and SHA-256.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  - Add the zkMIPS SDK (zkm-runtime) to your project.
  - Replace standard library calls with precompile versions.
    - Example: Use Keccak-256 precompile instead of tiny-keccak library for hashing.
- **Demo Example** üé•:
  - Running Rust EVM on zkMIPS using a project template.
  - Compute code hash of account information.
    - With tiny-keccak: ~156 seconds proof time, ~450-500 KB proof size.
    - With precompile: Reduced to ~38 seconds, proof size remains similar.
- **Supplementary Info**:
  - zkMIPS emulates a MIPS processor in a ZK-friendly way, allowing verifiable execution of programs.
  - Precompiles reduce proof overhead by specializing circuits, akin to how GPUs accelerate specific tasks vs. CPUs.
  - Pro tip: Always benchmark proof times before/after to quantify gains üìä.

# Implementing Custom Precompile on zkMIPS üîß

- **Overview**: Developers can implement custom precompiles during the proving phase without altering the verifier.
  - Three main steps: Implement precompile interface, syscall functions, and STARK circuits.
- **Step 1: Precompile Interface** üìù:
  - Treat it as a regular function in your Rust program.
  - Invoke syscall inside to handle precompile logic.
    - Example: For SHA-256 compress, call syscall for extend and compress functions.
  - Related: Interfaces abstract syscall details, similar to API wrappers in software development.

# Syscall Functions Implementation ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Basics**: Syscalls are MIPS instructions; implement logic and state transitions.
- **Key Sub-Steps**:
  - Assign a unique syscall number to your custom function.
  - Pass inputs via registers (e.g., syscall num in register 2, inputs in register 4).
  - In the emulator: Retrieve register values and handle logic based on syscall number.
    - Example: For SHA-256 extend, follow the algorithm from relevant specs/paper.
- **State Transition**:
  - Move cryptographic computations outside CPU tables by creating new tables.
  - Generate table traces for these new tables.
  - Maintain data dependencies: Push memory read/write ops to memory trace table for lookups.
    - Also applies to CPU table interactions.
- **Enhancements**:
  - Syscalls in MIPS are like interrupts in modern OSes, handling privileged operations.
  - In ZK context, ensure transitions are provable without revealing data üîí.

# Implementing STARK Circuits üìê

- **Approach**: Follow four parallel steps for clarity (consider them iteratively in practice).
- **Step 1: Determine Tables**:
  - Typically, two tables per syscall:
    - **Control Table**: Handles precompile logic and computation.
    - **Sponge Table**: Manages input/output, memory reads/writes.
  - Rows needed: Usually one row per sponge table invocation; variable for control based on complexity.
  - Optimization: Merge into one table if logic is simple to reduce overhead.
- **Step 2: Define Columns and Constraints**:
  - **Sponge Table Columns**:
    - Timestamp (clock cycle) ‚è∞.
    - Addresses and values for inputs/outputs.
    - Conditional flags.
    - Example: SHA-256 extend includes flags, I/O values, addresses, timestamp.
  - **Constraints**:
    - Evaluated natively on field elements and recursively for STARK compatibility.
    - Max degree: 3; add intermediate columns if higher.
    - Types: Flag constraints, address change constraints.
    - Use cross-table lookups for memory read/write verification.
  - **Control Table Columns**:
    - Timestamp, input/output values.
    - Intermediate values during computation.
    - Conditional flags.
    - Example: SHA-256 extend table with computation intermediates.
  - **Constraints**:
    - Conditional flag constraints.
    - Computation constraints.
    - Verify ops (e.g., XOR, AND) via cross-table lookups.
- **Related Concepts**:
  - STARKs (Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge) use algebraic intermediate representations for proofs.
  - Constraints ensure circuit integrity, like polynomials in PLONK or R1CS in other ZK systems.
  - Emoji insight: Tables are like spreadsheets in ZK ‚Äì rows prove steps, columns hold variables üìë.

  - Timestamp.
  - Flag values.
  - Input/output values.
  - Intermediates computed during generation.
- **Padding Requirement**:

  - Add padded (empty) rows at the end.
- **Supplementary**:
  - Traces represent program execution step-by-step, verifiable via Fiat-Shamir heuristic in ZKPs.
  - Similar to execution traces in debuggers, but optimized for polynomial commitments.

# Cross-Table Lookups for Data Dependencies üîó

- **Purpose**: Verify consistency across tables (e.g., input/output matching).
- **Implementation**:
  - Specify data and apply filters for which rows/columns to check.
  - Examples of pairs:
    - Sponge and Control: Match timestamps and I/O values.
    - Sponge and Memory: Verify reads/writes.
    - Sponge and CPU: Ensure state consistency.
    - Control and Logic: For ops like XOR/AND.
- **How-To**:
  - Define lookup arguments: Columns like timestamp, input values.
  - Filter to relevant rows (e.g., where flags indicate active computation).
- **Enhancements**:
  - Lookups are like database joins in ZK, ensuring no tampering across components.
  - In advanced ZKVMs, they enable modular circuit design, reducing overall complexity üß©.
