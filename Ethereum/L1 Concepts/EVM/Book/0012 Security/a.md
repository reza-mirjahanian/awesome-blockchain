EVM-Specific Vulnerabilities and Exploits
---
### Reentrancy
**Reentrancy** is a vulnerability where a function in a smart contract makes an external call to another untrusted contract. The untrusted contract can then make a recursive call back to the original function before the initial invocation is complete, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and theft of funds.

**Tricky Parts**: The vulnerability often arises when the state of the contract is not updated *before* the external call. The `call` function in Solidity is particularly dangerous as it forwards all remaining gas, giving the external contract ample resources to perform a reentrant attack.

**Use Cases & Edge Cases**:
* **Single-Function Reentrancy**: The most common form, where a function is called repeatedly.
* **Cross-Function Reentrancy**: An attacker calls a different function in the vulnerable contract during the reentrant call.
* **"Read-only" Reentrancy**: A seemingly benign external call that only reads state can be exploited if the called contract has a fallback function that then calls a state-changing function in the original contract.

**Code Snippet (Vulnerable)**:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableBank {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        uint bal = balances[msg.sender];
        require(bal > 0);

        (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: bal}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");

        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}

contract Attacker {
    VulnerableBank public vulnerableBank;

    constructor(address bankAddress) {
        vulnerableBank = VulnerableBank(bankAddress);
    }

    // Fallback function is executed when Ether is sent to this contract
    receive() external payable {
        if (address(vulnerableBank).balance >= 1 ether) {
            vulnerableBank.withdraw();
        }
    }

    function attack() public payable {
        require(msg.value >= 1 ether);
        vulnerableBank.deposit{value: msg.value}();
        vulnerableBank.withdraw();
    }
}
```

**Prevention**:
* **Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern**: Perform all internal checks and state changes *before* interacting with external contracts.
* **Reentrancy Guard**: Use a mutex (a boolean flag) to lock the contract during a function's execution. OpenZeppelin provides a widely-used `ReentrancyGuard` contract.
* **Use `transfer()` or `send()` (with caution)**: For simple Ether transfers, `transfer()` and `send()` have a gas limit of 2300, which is generally not enough for a reentrant call. However, they are not recommended for contracts that may need more gas in their fallback functions.

### Integer Overflow and Underflow
This vulnerability occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is outside the range of the data type used to store it. An **overflow** happens when the result is larger than the maximum value, and an **underflow** occurs when it's smaller than the minimum value.

**Tricky Parts**: Prior to Solidity 0.8.0, these operations would wrap around silently. For example, a `uint8` with a value of 255 would become 0 if 1 was added. Since Solidity 0.8.0, arithmetic operations revert on overflow and underflow by default. However, this protection is not present inside `unchecked` blocks.

**Code Snippet (Vulnerable - pre-0.8.0)**:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity <0.8.0;

contract TimeLock {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    mapping(address => uint) public lockTime;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        lockTime[msg.sender] = block.timestamp + 1 weeks;
    }

    function increaseLockTime(uint _secondsToIncrease) public {
        lockTime[msg.sender] += _secondsToIncrease;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] > 0);
        require(block.timestamp > lockTime[msg.sender]);
        msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}
```
*In the above example, a malicious user could call `increaseLockTime` with a large number that causes an overflow in `lockTime[msg.sender]`, effectively setting their lock time to a very small value and allowing premature withdrawal.*

**Prevention**:
* **Use Solidity 0.8.0+**: This is the simplest and most effective prevention.
* **SafeMath Libraries**: For older Solidity versions, use libraries like OpenZeppelin's `SafeMath` which provide functions that check for overflow and underflow.

**Pros/Cons of `unchecked` blocks (Solidity 0.8.0+)**

| Pros                               | Cons                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Gas savings by omitting overflow/underflow checks. | Introduces risk of vulnerabilities. |
| Can be useful for specific, well-understood arithmetic. | Requires careful auditing to ensure safety. |

**O() Notation**: Arithmetic opcodes in the EVM have a constant time complexity, so they are **O(1)**. The gas cost is fixed for each operation.

### `delegatecall` Vulnerabilities
The `delegatecall` opcode allows a contract to execute code from another contract, but in the context of the calling contract's state. This is a powerful feature for creating upgradeable contracts and libraries, but it's also fraught with peril.

**Tricky Parts**: The most common mistake is a **storage layout mismatch**. If the calling contract and the library contract do not have the exact same storage variable layout, the library's code can overwrite unexpected storage slots in the calling contract. Another issue is when the logic of the library contract can be manipulated to alter the state of the calling contract in unintended ways.

**Code Snippet (Vulnerable)**:
```solidity
// Library contract
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Lib {
    address public owner;

    function doSomething(uint256 _num) public {
        // Some logic
    }
}

// Calling contract with a different storage layout
contract MyContract {
    address public implementation;
    address public owner; // 'owner' is in the second storage slot

    constructor(address _implementation) {
        implementation = _implementation;
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function doSomething(uint256 _num) public {
        (bool success, ) = implementation.delegatecall(
            abi.encodeWithSignature("doSomething(uint256)", _num)
        );
        require(success);
    }
}
```
*If an attacker can somehow get `MyContract` to `delegatecall` a malicious library that has a function which writes to storage slot 1, they could change the `owner` of `MyContract`.*

**Real-World Example**: The **Parity Wallet "freeze"** was a famous incident where a library contract was accidentally "killed," and because many wallets relied on this library via `delegatecall`, they became unusable.

### Gas-Related Vulnerabilities

#### Gas Limit & Denial of Service (DoS)
An attacker can create a situation where executing a function becomes prohibitively expensive, effectively making it unusable. This can happen if a function iterates over an unbounded array that an attacker can fill with data.

**Code Snippet (Vulnerable)**:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Distributor {
    address[] public investors;

    function invest() public payable {
        investors.push(msg.sender);
    }

    function distribute() public {
        for (uint i = 0; i < investors.length; i++) {
            payable(investors[i]).transfer(1 ether);
        }
    }
}
```
*If many investors join, the `distribute` function's gas cost will eventually exceed the block gas limit, making it impossible to execute.*

**Prevention**:
* Favor pull-over-push patterns. Instead of the contract pushing funds, allow users to withdraw their share individually.

#### Unchecked External Calls
If a contract makes an external call and doesn't check the return value, the execution will continue even if the external call failed. This can lead to an inconsistent state.

**Code Snippet (Vulnerable)**:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract UncheckedSend {
    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        // This will not revert if the send fails
        payable(msg.sender).send(amount);
    }
}
```

**Prevention**:
* Use `transfer()` which reverts on failure.
* If using `call`, explicitly check the boolean return value: `(bool success, ) = to.call{value: amount}(""); require(success, "Transfer failed.");`

---
### Timestamp Dependence & Oracle Manipulation

#### Timestamp Dependence
Relying on `block.timestamp` for critical logic can be risky because miners have some leeway to manipulate it. They can report a timestamp that is slightly in the future or past.

**Real-World Usage**: Often used in time-locking mechanisms or to seed randomness (which is highly discouraged).

**Prevention**:
* Do not use `block.timestamp` for entropy or for actions that require high-precision timing.
* For time-based logic, use `block.number` if possible, as it is more difficult for miners to manipulate significantly.
* If precise timing is needed, consider using a decentralized oracle solution.

#### Oracle Manipulation
Contracts often rely on oracles to get external data (e.g., the price of an asset). If the oracle is centralized or can be manipulated, the contract can be exploited.

**Real-World Example**: Many DeFi protocols have suffered losses due to attackers manipulating the price of an asset on a single, unaudited exchange that was being used as a price oracle.

**Prevention**:
* Use decentralized oracle networks (e.g., Chainlink) that aggregate data from multiple sources.
* Use Time-Weighted Average Prices (TWAPs) which are more resistant to short-term price manipulation.

### Miscellaneous Vulnerabilities

#### Short Address Attack
This is a less common vulnerability that can occur if a dApp or user interface does not properly pad an address that is shorter than the standard 20 bytes. When this malformed address is sent to the EVM, the missing bytes can be filled with data from the following function argument, leading to unexpected behavior. This is largely a client-side issue.

#### Improper Initialization
If a contract can be initialized more than once, an attacker might be able to take ownership or change critical parameters.

**Code Snippet (Vulnerable)**:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyToken {
    address public owner;

    function init(address _owner) public {
        owner = _owner;
    }
}
```
*The `init` function can be called by anyone at any time.*

**Prevention**:
* Use a `constructor` for initialization, as it only runs once during deployment.
* For upgradeable contracts, use an `initializer` modifier that ensures the initialization function can only be called once.

**Comparison of Vulnerabilities**

| Vulnerability          | Root Cause                                      | Impact                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Reentrancy** | External call before state update.              | Theft of funds, unexpected state changes.  |
| **Integer Overflow** | Arithmetic operation exceeds type's bounds.     | Logic errors, potential for fund theft.    |
| **`delegatecall` Abuse** | Storage layout mismatch or malicious library.   | Contract takeover, fund theft.             |
| **Gas Limit DoS** | Unbounded loops or data structures.             | Contract functionality becomes unusable.   |
| **Timestamp Dependence**| Relying on manipulable `block.timestamp`.       | Unfair advantages, incorrect logic execution.|

**Next Steps Suggestion**:
For a deeper dive into the low-level mechanics of the EVM and how they can be exploited, the next logical topic to explore would be **EVM opcode-level security analysis and gas golfing techniques**. This involves understanding how Solidity compiles down to EVM bytecode and how attackers can manipulate gas costs and execution flow at the most granular level.
