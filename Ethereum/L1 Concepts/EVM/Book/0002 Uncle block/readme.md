What are uncle block rewards?
-----------------------------

Uncle block rewards are rewards awarded to miners who create an uncle block included in a valid block added to the chain.

Uncle blocks are similar to stale blocks in bitcoin, except instead of being ignored, uncle blocks are awarded dependent on how new they are, with the most significant payout being 4.375 eth. An example of this reward can be foundÂ [here](https://etherscan.io/block/1378035).

How do uncle block rewards get mined?
-------------------------------------

When miners of the main chain block reference uncle blocks, both the miner of the main chain block and the miner of the uncle block receive an additional reward.

Each block in the main chain can reference up to two uncle blocks, with each uncle receiving 1/32 of an entire block reward. The reward provided to the uncle block miner, on the other hand, declines over time.

What is the difference between an uncle block and an orphan block?
------------------------------------------------------------------

The difference between an uncle block and an orphan block is that the Ethereum network rewards its uncle block miners. In contrast, the Bitcoin network does not compensate/reward orphan block miners.
