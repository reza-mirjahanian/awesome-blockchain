Unlike the Ethereum Mainnet, the Beacon Chain does **not handle** transactions orÂ [smart contracts](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/tutorials/hello-world-smart-contract). Instead, it coordinates the entire Ethereum network by managing its stakers (who validate the proof of stake blocks) and shard chains (split-up chains of the main network).


In comparison, PoS solves this by **semi-randomly  selecting** only a few "validators" at a time to validate the transactions in the next block and propose that block to the blockchain. This is called "**minting**" blocks, as compared to "mining" in PoW.
