# Ethereum Execution Layer

The **Execution Layer (EL)** in Ethereum is essentially a state machine that executes transactions and smart contracts via the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).  It maintains a persistent world state (account balances, contract storage, etc.) and applies the state-transition function defined by Ethereum’s protocol.  As a core part of the post-Merge architecture, the execution layer runs as a separate client process that includes the EVM, state database, transaction pool, networking, and RPC interfaces.  Its design follows Ethereum’s modular (“*encapsulated complexity*”) philosophy, separating execution from consensus for maintainability and upgradeability.

&#x20;*Illustration: The EVM’s architecture. Each transaction is executed by the EVM, which maintains a volatile **machine state** (program counter, stack, memory, gas) and updates a persistent **world state** (accounts and storage).*

At its core, the execution layer comprises: (1) the **EVM** – Ethereum’s instruction-set and execution engine, which processes bytecode and enforces gas costs; (2) a **world-state database** (a Merkle-Patricia Trie) holding all account and contract data; (3) a **transaction pool (mempool)** where pending transactions are gossiped and queued; and (4) the **Engine API/JSON-RPC interface** for communication with other parts of the system.  In practice, an execution client implements these components and manages peer-to-peer networking for the execution layer, relaying transactions and execution payloads.  Crucially, after the Merge Ethereum adopted a *dual-client* architecture: an execution client process (the EL) and a consensus client (the CL). These communicate via the standardized **Engine API**. This modular split (illustrated below) encapsulates complexity and allows each layer to be developed independently.

&#x20;*Diagram: An execution client’s internal components. The execution client runs the EVM and maintains the execution state (world-state database), processes transactions from the mempool, and communicates with the consensus client via RPC.*

The execution layer design is built around a few key principles: **full state correctness**, **deterministic execution**, and **modularity**.  Every valid block must include a Merkle root of the state trie, ensuring immutability of all account data.  The EVM’s gas accounting enforces that computation and storage changes have bounded cost.  By decoupling execution from consensus (using the Engine API), Ethereum can upgrade each layer independently and support multiple implementations.  For example, after the Merge, any consensus client can pair with any compliant execution client to form a full node.  The Ethereum.org docs emphasize this approach as *“encapsulated complexity”*, making client codebases easier to maintain and reuse.

## Interaction with the Consensus Layer

After the Merge (Sep 2022), Ethereum’s execution layer and consensus layer (the Beacon Chain) work together to produce and validate blocks.  The consensus layer (CL) in Proof-of-Stake decides which validator proposes a block in each slot, but it **relies on the execution layer to actually execute transactions and validate block contents**.  In practice, when a validator is selected to propose, the consensus client calls the execution client (locally) via the **Engine API** to create an execution payload.  This “create block” RPC causes the execution client to pull pending transactions from its mempool, execute them in the EVM, and produce a block header (transactions, state root, etc.). The consensus client then embeds this execution payload into the Beacon block.

The Beacon chain specifies in each block an **ExecutionPayload** (essentially an Eth1-style block header and list of transactions).  Critically, the consensus layer does **not re-execute transactions itself**.  Instead, it uses Engine API calls (e.g. `engine_newPayload`) to submit the proposed block to the execution client.  Under the Bellatrix and Capella specifications, for each block the Beacon node invokes `notify_new_payload()` on the execution engine.  As the Eth2 Book notes, *“The beacon chain does not know how to validate Ethereum transactions… it hands off validation of the execution payload to a locally connected execution client”* via this call. The execution client returns a status indicating whether the payload is valid (checking gas limits, state root, etc.). Only if the execution client accepts the payload is the block considered valid by the consensus client. In this way, the Engine API (an RPC interface) bridges execution and consensus: the consensus client assembles blocks and fork-choice, while the execution client enforces all transaction and EVM rules.

&#x20;*Diagram: Post-Merge node architecture. Each node runs one consensus client and one execution client. They communicate via the **Engine API** (RPC calls for payloads and forkchoice).*

In summary, interaction flows typically follow these steps:

* **Transaction dissemination:** Users broadcast transactions over the execution-layer P2P network. All execution clients gossip and add them to their **mempool**.
* **Block proposal (execution):** When a validator is chosen, the **consensus client** calls the execution client to build a block. The execution client packages transactions from the mempool, executes them in order (updating state, consuming gas), and produces a block header including the new state root and transaction list.
* **Block submission:** The consensus client receives the execution payload (via Engine API) and includes it in the Beacon block it proposes. That block is gossiped to other nodes.
* **Validation and finalization:** Other nodes receive the Beacon block; their consensus client again calls its execution client to validate the payload (via `notify_new_payload`). Once enough attestations accrue, the block is finalized by Proof-of-Stake rules.

Thus, the execution layer is responsible for *execution and state* while the consensus layer orders blocks and ensures agreement.  This division means the consensus client treats the execution client as a black-box validator for block contents. In practice, all major execution clients implement the Engine API to allow seamless handoff of payloads and fork-choice information.

## Major Execution Layer Clients

Several full-node **execution clients** exist, written in different languages and optimized for various use cases.  The most widely used clients are:

* **Geth (Go)** – The original Ethereum client (also called Go-Ethereum), developed by the Ethereum Foundation. Geth supports all sync modes (snap, full, archive). It is considered the flagship client, noted as *“widely regarded as the most advanced client”*. Geth has the largest market share by nodes (around 60–70%). It is broadly used and well-tested across tools, wallets and infrastructure.
* **Nethermind (C#/.NET)** – A high-performance .NET client (supports Windows, Linux, macOS, and ARM). Nethermind emphasizes speed and configurability. It includes an optimized EVM and rich monitoring tools (Prometheus/Grafana dashboards, RPC tracing, etc.). In recent months its usage has grown: for example, Coinbase reported migrating about half its validators to Nethermind, boosting its share of validator clients to \~22%. Nethermind supports snap, fast, and full sync modes.
* **Besu (Java)** – An enterprise-grade client maintained by ConsenSys/Hyperledger. Besu is written in Java and supports mainnet and permissioned networks. It provides extensive features (including transaction tracing, JSON-RPC, GraphQL, and enterprise SLAs) and is the go-to choice for many permissioned Ethereum deployments. Besu’s market share is smaller (around 7–10%).
* **Erigon (Go)** – A fork of Geth (formerly “Turbo-Geth”) with a re-engineered database and sync algorithm. Erigon does *not* serve snapshots; it supports full archive and pruned sync. Its main goal is efficiency: Erigon uses a staged sync and a compact flat-key storage that lets it sync much faster and use less disk space than Geth for archival nodes. This makes it popular for resource-constrained environments. Erigon’s node share is modest (\~6–7%), but it is favored for fast sync and block data indexing.

These clients all fully implement the Execution Layer protocol, pass the official client test suite, and remain in active development. In practice, **client diversity** is important: Ethereum strives to avoid any client exceeding \~33% share, because a client-specific bug in >1/3 of validators could halt finality. Currently Geth dominates execution clients, so efforts by teams like Nethermind and Erigon to onboard validators (for instance via Coinbase) are notable for decentralization.

Other implementations exist (e.g. **Reth** in Rust, or EthereumJS in TypeScript) but are less common. Each client has strengths: e.g. Geth’s large ecosystem; Nethermind’s .NET tooling; Besu’s enterprise integrations; Erigon’s efficiency. Operators typically choose a client based on factors like performance, supported features, or familiarity.

## Roles and Responsibilities

The Execution Layer’s responsibilities can be summarized as follows:

* **Transaction Execution:** Applying the Ethereum state transition function. The EL receives transactions (via P2P gossip and RPC), executes them in the EVM (moving value, invoking contracts, updating storage), and ensures the **state root** matches the block header. This includes running all opcodes and accounting for gas. As noted by Ethereum docs, the execution client “*listens to new transactions broadcast to the network, executes them in the EVM and holds the latest state and database of all current data on the Ethereum network*”.
* **State Management:** Maintaining and updating the **world state**. The execution client stores the Merkle-Patricia tries of accounts, balances, contract code and storage. On each block, it updates this world state. It must also manage a local database (often LevelDB or similar) to keep all historical blockchain data (for archival nodes) or a pruned state (for non-archive nodes).
* **Gas and Consensus Inputs:** Calculating gas used and enforcing protocol rules. The EL enforces gas limits (per block and per transaction), fees, and rewards (e.g. allocating the block’s coinbase address). It also supplies the consensus layer with execution results (state root, transaction receipts, and block hash). For example, every Beacon block includes the header fields from the execution payload (parent hash, state root, receipts root, etc.); ensuring these are correct falls to the execution engine.
* **Block Assembly:** For block proposers, bundling a valid block. As described, when instructed by the consensus layer to build a block, the execution client selects pending transactions (typically sorted by fee) from its mempool and executes them in sequence, producing a candidate block with all transaction changes applied.
* **Networking and Mempool:** Running the Ethereum **P2P network** for the execution layer. Execution clients participate in devp2p/enode connections, gossip transaction and block hashes, and propagate new transactions. They maintain a mempool of pending transactions until inclusion in a block.
* **RPC/API Services:** Providing user and wallet interfaces. Execution clients expose JSON-RPC endpoints (e.g. `eth_sendRawTransaction`, `eth_call`, `eth_syncing`, etc.) and often WebSockets. They answer queries about balances, pending transactions, and call EVM methods (like estimateGas or read-only calls).

In short, the execution layer *implements the Ethereum state machine*: applying transactions to state, storing the result, and interfacing with the consensus layer via the Engine API. All contract execution, EVM logic, storage trie updates, and fee calculations happen here. The consensus layer then uses these outputs (state root, receipts, etc.) to maintain chain finality. The **final linkage** is that every finalized block’s data (transactions and state changes) has originated and been validated by the execution layer.

## Recent Developments

Several major protocol upgrades and EIPs have recently affected the execution layer (and more are forthcoming). Key changes **since the Merge** include:

* **Shapella (Shanghai/Capella, Apr 2023):** This hard fork enabled staked ETH withdrawals and included multiple execution-layer EIPs. Notably, EIP-4895 permitted validator withdrawals (consensus-critical). On the execution side, Ethereum deployed:

  * **EIP-3651 (Warm COINBASE):** Marks the coinbase (block reward address) as “warm” to reduce gas cost of accessing it.
  * **EIP-3855 (PUSH0):** Introduces a new `PUSH0` opcode to push constant 0 to the stack, saving gas on many contracts.
  * **EIP-3860 (Initcode Size Limiter):** Caps the size of contract creation initcode, ensuring gas costs scale with code length.
    These EIPs optimize contract execution and gas accounting. (The full Shapella specs are described in Ethereum Foundation announcements.)

* **Dencun (Cancún & Deneb, Apr 2024):** This combined upgrade introduced **9 EIPs**, primarily to prepare for shard-based scalability. The standout is **EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding)**, which adds a new transaction type carrying large “blobs” of data for a short period, drastically reducing L2 rollup data costs. Other execution-layer EIPs include MCOPY (EIP-5656, for efficient memory copying), EIP-6780 (revision of `SELFDESTRUCT` semantics), EIP-1153 (transient storage for cheaper intra-transaction data), and EIP-7044/EIP-7045 (execution improvements), among others. Dencun also integrated EIP-4788 to expose the parent beacon block root in the EVM, aiding oracles and liquid staking. Overall, Dencun primed Ethereum for sharded data availability, and **EIP-4844** was widely hailed as “the biggest change to the execution layer since the Merge”.

* **Upcoming Pectra (Oct/Nov 2024):** This upgrade focuses on **account abstraction**. The centerpiece is **EIP-7702**, which lets Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) temporarily behave like smart contract accounts within a single transaction. In practice, this gives user wallets more flexibility (delegating signature verification to smart contracts). EIP-7702 is considered a major step toward account abstraction and will require corresponding changes in execution clients. The Pectra upgrade will also include other EIPs (e.g. for better user experience), as announced by the Ethereum Foundation.

Beyond these, other execution-related changes continue to be proposed. For example, EIP-1559 (the 2021 London upgrade) fundamentally changed fees by burning base fees – a change still in effect post-Merge. Research on **Verkle trees** (improving state storage for future “Purge” upgrades) and further sharding EIPs continues. All active execution-layer proposals are tracked in Ethereum’s EIP repository and client specs. (Developers often prototype new EIPs using the Python Execution Layer Specification for clarity.)

**Summary:**  The Execution Layer’s architecture centers on the EVM and state database, executing all transactions and managing the Ethereum state.  It interfaces with the Consensus Layer via the Engine API for block production and validation.  Multiple client implementations (Geth, Nethermind, Besu, Erigon, etc.) each realize this architecture with different optimizations. Post-Merge upgrades like Shapella and Dencun have introduced significant EIPs (e.g. warm COINBASE, PUSH0, Proto-Danksharding) that optimize execution and pave the way for future scaling. Throughout, the Execution Layer’s role remains executing transactions and updating state in a deterministic, verifiable way, forming one half of Ethereum’s two-layer node design.
