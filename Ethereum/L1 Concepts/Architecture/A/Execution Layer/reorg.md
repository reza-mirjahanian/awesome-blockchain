## üîÅ 1. Finality

| Aspect             | **Eth1 (PoW)**                                                                         | **Eth2 (PoS, post-Merge)**                                                             |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**     | No true finality; blocks are considered "final" after confirmations (e.g., 12 blocks). | Finality is **deterministic** using **Casper FFG** (Finality Gadget).                  |
| **Mechanism**      | Probabilistic: More confirmations = higher confidence.                                 | Epoch-based: Finality is achieved every 2 epochs (\~12.8 min).                         |
| **Security Model** | Based on longest-chain rule.                                                           | Based on 2/3 majority of validators voting on checkpoints.                             |
| **Rollback Risk**  | High: Large enough hash power can reorganize deep blocks.                              | Extremely low: Finalized blocks can only be reverted with ‚â•1/3 slashing (very costly). |

‚úÖ **PoS has stronger and faster finality guarantees.**

## üîÑ 2. Reorg Problem

| Aspect            | **Eth1 (PoW)**                                         | **Eth2 (PoS)**                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cause**         | Natural due to propagation delays or malicious miners. | Possible due to delayed validator attestations or bugs.                |
| **Frequency**     | Common (minor reorgs of 1-2 blocks regularly occur).   | Rare (attestation delays may cause 1-block reorgs, but less frequent). |
| **Security Risk** | Reorgs allow MEV attacks, double-spends.               | Reorgs beyond 1-2 slots are penalized, costly for validators.          |
| **Impact**        | Greater uncertainty for dApps and exchanges.           | Low impact due to slashing + fast finality.                            |

‚úÖ **PoS significantly reduces reorg frequency and depth.**

## üåø 3. Forks

| Aspect               | **Eth1 (PoW)**                                     | **Eth2 (PoS)**                                               |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Fork Creation**    | Competing miners can create chains easily.         | Forks require large validator sets to split.                 |
| **Coordination**     | Easy to split hash power (e.g., Ethereum Classic). | Harder: Coordinated validator exit or dual-signing required. |
| **Historical Forks** | Ethereum Classic (2016)                            | ETHW (PoW fork post-Merge, minority chain)                   |
| **Resistance**       | Weak ‚Äî minority hashpower can maintain forks.      | Strong ‚Äî economic penalties discourage forks.                |

‚úÖ **PoS discourages forks through economic finality and slashing.**

## üîö Summary Table

| Feature      | **Eth1 (PoW)**                   | **Eth2 (PoS)**                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Finality** | Probabilistic (no hard finality) | Deterministic finality via Casper FFG         |
| **Reorgs**   | Frequent, up to several blocks   | Rare, minimal depth                           |
| **Forks**    | Easier to execute (low-cost)     | Economically discouraged (validator slashing) |

### üß† Conclusion:

Ethereum's transition from **Eth1 ‚Üí Eth2** (PoW ‚Üí PoS) addressed critical security and stability concerns:

* **Stronger finality guarantees** through validator consensus.
* **Reduced likelihood and severity of reorgs**.
* **Lower probability and incentives for forking**.

The new PoS system is more secure, predictable, and finality-oriented, which is especially important for DeFi, rollups, and high-value transactions.
