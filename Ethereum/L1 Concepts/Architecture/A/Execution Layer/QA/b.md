# ðŸ”¹ Basics of Ethereum Execution Layer

### **1. What is the Execution Layer in Ethereum?**

**Answer:**
The Execution Layer is responsible for:

* Executing transactions
* Managing account state and balances
* Processing smart contract logic (EVM)
* Maintaining and updating the Ethereum state trie

It works in tandem with the **Consensus Layer** (post-Merge) which provides finality and fork choice.

---

### **2. How did the role of the Execution Layer change after The Merge?**

**Answer:**
Before The Merge:

* Execution and consensus were handled by a single client (e.g., Geth).

After The Merge:

* Execution Layer (e.g., Geth) handles transaction execution.
* Consensus Layer (e.g., Lighthouse) handles block validation, attestations, and finality.
* They communicate via the **Engine API**.

---

### **3. What are the main components of a block in the Execution Layer?**

**Answer:**

1. **Header**
2. **Transactions**
3. **Ommers (Uncles)**

---

### **4. What is the Engine API?**

**Answer:**
A JSON-RPC interface used by the Consensus Layer to communicate with the Execution Layer. It includes methods like:

* `engine_newPayloadV2`
* `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV2`
* `engine_getPayloadV2`

---

# ðŸ”¹ Ethereum Block Structure (Execution Layer)

### **6. What is `baseFeePerGas`?**

**Answer:**
Introduced in **EIP-1559**, it:

* Represents the minimum gas price for inclusion in a block.
* Is adjusted dynamically based on network congestion.

* Nonces
* Code hashes
* Storage roots

---

### **8. What is the difference between `transactionsRoot` and `receiptsRoot`?**

* `transactionsRoot`: Root of trie storing all transactions in the block.

### **13. What are gas and gas costs?**

**Answer:**

* **Gas** is the unit of computational cost.
* **Each EVM operation (opcode)** has an associated gas cost.

---

### **14. What causes an out-of-gas exception?**

**Answer:**
Occurs when a transaction or contract runs out of allotted gas before completion, causing a full **revert**.

---

# ðŸ”¹ Transaction Lifecycle and Execution

### **15. What is the lifecycle of a transaction in the Execution Layer?**

---

### **18. How is a smart contract deployed in the Execution Layer?**

**Answer:**

* A transaction with empty `to` field and contract bytecode in `data`.
