Ideally we'd like to store everything in Ethereum storage, which is stored across thousands of computers and has extremely high availability (the data cannot be censored) and integrity (the data cannot be modified in an unauthorized manner), but storing a 32-byte word typically costs 20,000 gas. As I'm writing this, that cost is equivalent to $6.60. At 21 cents per byte this is too expensive for many uses.

To solve this problem the Ethereum ecosystem developed [many alternative ways to store data in a decentralized fashion](/en/developers/docs/storage/). Usually they involve a tradeoff between availability and price. However, integrity is usually assured.

In this article you learn **how** to ensure data integrity without storing the data on the blockchain, using [Merkle proofs(opens in a new tab)](https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/Merkle_proof)
