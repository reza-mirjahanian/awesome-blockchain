### Overview of ZK Proofs-Based Protocols

**Protocols Discussed:**
1. ZK Sync
2. Loopring
3. Polygon ZKEVM

**Common Features:**
- Utilize ZK proofs for privacy and security.
- Settle transactions on Layer 2, leading to low gas fees and enhanced scalability.

### Key Differences

**1. Initial Launch:**
- **ZK Sync:** Launched in 2020 by Matter Labs.
- **Loopring:** Launched in 2019 by Loopring Technologies (earliest ZK roll-up based protocol).
- **Polygon ZKEVM:** Launched in 2023 by Polygon Labs.

**2. Transaction Handling:**
- **ZK Sync and Polygon ZKEVM:**
  - Work with batched transactions.
  - Settle transactions on their Layer 2 chain.
  - Create a batch of those transactions and send them to the Ethereum main chain (Layer 1).
- **Loopring:**
  - Uses off-chain order matching with its relayer.
  - ZK proof-based application-driven protocol with its own decentralized exchange.

**3. Smart Contracts:**
- **ZK Sync:** Supports EVM-based smart contracts with minor opcode differences.
- **Loopring:** Primarily supports decentralized exchanges with its own set of smart contracts for developing DEXs.
- **Polygon ZKEVM:** Fully EVM compatible, supporting Solidity-based EVM-compatible smart contracts with minor opcode changes.

**4. Native Tokens:**
- **ZK Sync and Polygon ZKEVM:** Support ETH (Ether) as their native token.
- **Loopring:** Has its own native token called Loopring Coin (LRC).

### Use Cases

- **ZK Sync and Polygon ZKEVM:**
  - Complete Layer 2 chains.
  - Can be used to build any kind of decentralized applications (dApps) with the security of the Ethereum main layer.
- **Loopring:**
  - DeFi or decentralized exchange-focused protocol.
  - Suitable for token applications, NFT applications, automated market makers, or creating decentralized exchanges.

### Protocol Upgrades

**1. ZK Sync:**
   - Requires 21 days' notice for upgrades.
   - In emergencies, upgrades can be done immediately if approved by 9 out of 15 Security Council multisig members.

**2. Loopring:**
   - Does not require any notice for upgrades.
   - Changes can be made arbitrarily.

**3. Polygon ZKEVM:**
   - Requires 10 days' notice for upgrades.
   - The Security Council can switch to an emergency state for immediate upgrades without notice.
