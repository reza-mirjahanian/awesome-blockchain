   <td>Polygon CDK validium uses validity proofs to enforce the integrity of state transitions, but it does not store transaction data on the Ethereum network.
<p>
The Polygon CDK validium is in fact a zero-knowledge validium (zkValidium) because it utilizes the Polygon zkEVM’s off-chain prover to produce zero-knowledge proofs, which are published as validity proofs.
<p>
The use of the above-mentioned prover, to a certain extent, adds trustlessness to the Polygon CDK validium.
<p>
The validium mode inherits, not just the prover, but all the Polygon zkEVM’s components and their functionalities, except that it does not publish transaction data on L1.
<p>
The validium configuration has one major advantage over the zkEVM rollup option: And that is, reduced gas fees due to the off-chain storage of transaction data, where only a hash of the transaction data gets stored on the Ethereum network.

In particular, when the number of actions, known as multicalls, goes beyond 195, it can use up all the available zk resources, leading to transaction failures.
<p>
To address this error, it's important to optimize the number of multicalls and reduce how often they are used. By doing this, you can prevent excessive resource consumption, avoid encountering this limitation, and ensure that your transactions run smoothly.

   <td>While it is possible to run a zkEVM on top of Polygon's Hermez zkEVM chain (as L3), it may involve additional complexities for asset withdrawal compared to zkEVM deployed directly on Ethereum mainnet (as L2). 
<p>
The recommended approach is to use Supernets as the L3 solution for simplicity and withdrawal efficiency. zkEVM and Supernets differ in terms of centralization and where assets are secured. If you opt for zkEVM as L3, you would need to withdraw assets from L3 to L2 and then from L2 to L1, adding extra consensus requirements. Ideally, is you use zkEVM for L3, you would also prefer using a zkEVM for L2.

<p>
However, for users who are bridging funds back to the Ethereum Mainnet, the transaction must reach the third and final stage of finality. In the current Mainnet Beta phase, this process is expected to take approximately 30 - 60 minutes. During this period, the transaction undergoes verification and validation processes to ensure its security and correctness before becoming fully settled on the Ethereum Mainnet.

   </td>

   <td>Absolutely! Optimizing gas costs is crucial when dealing with a large number of transactions. Here are some strategies to help you achieve gas efficiency:
<p>
Batch Transactions: Combine multiple transactions into a single batch transaction. This can be done using Ethereum's "contract calls in a single transaction" or EIP-2711 (multiple transactions in a single call). By bundling multiple operations together, you can eliminate redundant gas costs and reduce the overall gas consumption.
<p>
Gas-Efficient Contracts: Design your smart contracts with gas efficiency in mind. Minimize unnecessary storage operations, utilize events for off-chain data access, and implement gas-saving techniques like state channels or rollups if they are applicable to your use case.
<p>
Gas Estimation: Accurately estimate the gas limits for each transaction to avoid overestimating and consuming unnecessary gas. Use gas estimation libraries or simulators to determine the optimal gas limits for your specific transactions.

<h3>How does the LxLy Bridge work in general?</h3>

<p>
The overall process involved in LxLy is:
<ol>

<li>Deposit on L1: 
<ol>
 
<li>You start by sending assets to a special contract called PolygonZkEVMBridge on Ethereum L1.
 
<li>You specify details like the destination network (L2), your L2 address, the amount of assets, and the token contract address.
 
<li>Inside the contract, it checks if the destination is valid and handles Ether and ERC-20 tokens differently.
</li> 
</ol>

<li>Updating Records: 
<ol>
 
<li>The contract keeps records of your deposits and ensures their security.
 
<li>If necessary, it updates a global record to show your assets are ready to move.
</li> 
</ol>

<li>Transaction to L2: 
<ol>
 
<li>After a while, the records are updated on L2, often through a Sequencer.
 
<li>The L2 network checks this update, confirming your assets are now ready on L2.
</li> 
</ol>

<li>Claim on L2: 
<ol>
 
<li>You can then prove that the assets are yours on L2 by providing proof.
 
<li>You submit a transaction on L2 to claim your assets using the PolygonZkEVMBridge contract.
</li> 
</ol>

<li>Completion: 
<ol>
 
<li>The contract checks your proof and ensures the assets haven't been claimed before.
 
<li>It transfers your assets (Ether or tokens) accordingly.
 
<li>An event confirms the successful claim and your assets are now on L2

In summary, the LyLx Bridge is a versatile solution for connecting different blockchain networks, and it operates through a series of steps involving smart contracts, records, and verification mechanisms.

<p>
<strong>Current Status:</strong> During the initial phase of the Mainnet Beta Launch, users may not immediately push transactions to Ethereum Layer 1 (L1). However, it's part of our plan to enable this functionality approximately one month after the launch. Initially, it will be available on the ongoing testnet, followed by the mainnet.

Why the Delay?: While the feature is already prepared in our code, we are conducting thorough safety checks to prevent any issues when it goes live. Ensuring a smooth experience is our top priority.

So you can build a tree of proofs where the root proves a full chain segment. You can build this tree with the shape you want and in parallel. You can have one server aggregating proofs 1 and 2 while the other aggregates proofs 3 and 4. This proof takes 10s.
<p>
The last step is to send this aggregated proof on-chain. This proof is what stores the rollup state on-chain and allows the user to withdraw the funds. This happens once in a while (30 minutes in the case of the Polygon zkEVM).
<p>
For this last step the proof is converted from a STARK to a SNARK (FFLONK), this reduces the gas cost for verifying this proof on-chain. This process takes about 2min and the gas cost of the whole TX is about 350K no matter how long is the proving segment.

Provers cannot do much but generate proofs. So to have a decentralized system is much more critical (and difficult) than the sequencer.

<h3>What makes the total gas cost per L2 batch?</h3>


   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>The minimum gas price that will be accepted by the sequencer will depend on the TX. The sequencer will have a special call to get that price given for the transaction. This price will depend on the size of the data (data availability) and the usage of the zkCounters.
<p>
Said that and for Ethereum compatibility, the JSON-RPC call getGasPrice will return a gasPrice that will warranty that most of the TXs will fit. This price will be lower that the L1 price.
<p>
Users have an incentive to use the specific API to reduce the costs.

This getGastPricePerTX API is not implemented yet.

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>The sequencer retrieves the transaction from the transaction pool and verifies that it is properly formatted and contains all the necessary information.
<p>
The sequencer does the following checks:
<p>
1- Check that the transaction is valid by checking that the sender has enough funds to cover the gas costs of the transaction and that the smart contract called, if any, is valid and has the correct bytecode.
<p>
2- Check that the transaction is not a duplicate by checking the transaction nonce of the sender to ensure that it is one greater than the last nonce used.
<p>
3- Check that the transaction is not a double-spend by checking that the sender's account balance has not been already spent in another transaction.
<p>
Once the transaction is deemed valid, the sequencer applies the transaction to the current state of the Polygon zkEVM, updating the state of the smart contract and the account balances as necessary. Duration and cost vary depending on traffic and prevailing gas prices.

<h3>What is transaction finality?</h3>


   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Here are some factors influencing finality times;
<p>
First of all, note that the L2 State goes <strong>through 3 phases</strong>; the Trusted State, the Virtual State and the Consolidated (or Verified) State.
<p>
1. <strong>Trusted State means the L2 </strong>nodes are updated with batch info from the Trusted Sequencer before the sequencing of batches and hence no data availability in L1.
<p>
2. <strong>Virtual State means the L2</strong> nodes are updated with batch info after batches have been sequenced and the data is already in L1, but not yet verified.
<p>
3. <strong>Consolidated State means L2</strong> nodes are updated with batch info after the sequenced batches have been verified by the Aggregator.
<p>
In other words, If the user trusts the sequencer, transactions are considered final once the sequencer sequences it. If the user trust only the L1 state, then the transaction will be final at the moment it reaches Virtual State. This means, once the data is available and the transaction is already in L1.
<p>
If the user needs to withdraw funds, the user needs to wait for the prover to convert the implicit state to explicit state, we call this last state the Consolidated or Veriefied state

<h3>What are Forced Batches?</h3>

  </tr>

However, with the proving system breakthroughs pioneered by Polygon Labs, we believe we can achieve full EVM equivalence while offering better performance (higher throughput, lower latency, and lower cost) than alt-L1s, optimistic rollups and other ZK rollups.

<h3>What is the difference betweeen EVM compatbility and EVM equivalence?</h3>


   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>The ultimate goal is not compatibility. The ultimate goal is equivalence. Solutions that are compatible enable most of the existing apps to work, but sometimes with code changes. Additionally, compatibility may lead to the breaking of developer tooling. 
<p>
Polygon zkEVM strives for EVM Equivalence because it means that most applications, tools and infrastructure built on Ethereum can immediately port over to Polygon zkEVM with limited to no changes needed. Things are designed to work 100% on day one. This is important, because ideally:
<p>
1. Development teams don't have to make changes to their code, which could introduce a security vulnerability.
<p>
2. Since no code changes are needed, you don't need additional audits, which saves teams money.
<p>
3. The experience for a developer is much better. Since he/she is not rewriting the application, valuable time is saved.
<p>
4. The solution ultimately benefits from the security and decentralization of Ethereum, since transactions are still finalising on Ethereum.
<p>
5. Allows Polygon zkEVM to benefit from the already vibrant and active Ethereum community.
<p>
6. Allows for significant and quick dApp adoption, since apps built on Ethereum today are designed to be compatible.

   <td>Polygon zkEVM is an extension of the good old EVM, it allows for private computations to be performed on the blockchain using zk proofs.

The process of rollbacks and reverts is similar to regular EVMs. So when there is an error or a condition that triggers a revert, it uses the REVERT instruction to stop the execution and then returns an error message. 
<p>
Rollbacks can also happen sometimes because of an invalid zk proof (this triggers something new to Polygon zkEVM) which would cause the transaction to be aborted and all the state changes to be undone.
