# Polygon zkEVM: EVM Equivalence and Differences



## Overview of zkEVM

### Definition
- A virtual machine that executes smart contracts
- Compatible with zero-knowledge proof computation
- Aims to scale Ethereum, increase throughput, and lower fees

### Purpose
- Process transactions and create cryptographic proofs of execution
- Allow faster validation of transaction processing

## Types of zkEVMs

- Reference to Vitalik Buterin's classification of zkEVMs into five types
- Polygon zkEVM aims to be Type 2 (high compatibility, lower performance)
- Currently at "Type 2.2" (nearly Type 2, pending pre-compiles completion)

## Equivalence Concept

- **Definition**: Same input to zkEVM and EVM produces the same state output
- **Implication**: Identical state root, account balances, storage, etc.

## Technical Implementation

1. **Processor Design**
   - Uses clock cycles and states
   - Custom assembly language: zkASM

2. **Execution Process**
   - zkASM creates a build (trace of steps)
   - Executor uses zkASM build and PIL (Polynomial Identity Language)
   - Verifies correctness of each step during transaction processing

## Differences between zkEVM and EVM

1. **State Tree Structure**
   - EVM: Patricia Trie
   - zkEVM: Sparse Merkle Tree

2. **Account Storage**
   - EVM: All properties in one leaf
   - zkEVM: One property per leaf

3. **Hashing Algorithm**
   - EVM: Keccak256
   - zkEVM: Poseidon with Goldilocks prime field

4. **Tree Structure**
   - EVM: Multiple trees
   - zkEVM: Single tree for entire system

5. **Memory Management**
   - EVM: 8-bit (1 byte) memory slots
   - zkEVM: 256-bit (32 bytes) memory slots

6. **Counter System**
   - zkEVM: Introduces a counter system for operations

7. **Self-destruct**
   - EVM: Uses self-destruct
   - zkEVM: Implements 'send all' (following EIP-4758)

8. **Pre-compiles**
   - zkEVM: Currently supports only 3 (ecrecover, identity, modexp)

9. **Block Hash Access**
   - zkEVM: Allows access to all historical block hashes

10. **Memory Limit**
    - zkEVM: ~40 GB limit

11. **Transaction Types**
    - zkEVM: Currently not supporting EIP-155 and EIP-2718 (work in progress)

## Conclusion

- Polygon zkEVM passes 97% of Ethereum test suites
- Differences are mostly for equivalence and performance optimization
- Public testnet available for testing and feedback
