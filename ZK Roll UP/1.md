### Ethereum's Scalability Issues and Layer 2 Solutions

  

It’s no secret that Ethereum has scalability issues.  
That’s why  **Layer 2 solutions**, like rollups, have emerged.

  

### Rollup Scaling Solutions

  

Today we’ll explore the two rollup scaling solutions:

  

1.  **Optimistic Rollups**
2.  **Zero Knowledge Rollups (zk Rollups)**

  

But before we get into their differences, let's understand what blockchain rollups are in the first place.

  

### What Are Blockchain Rollups?

  

Simply put,  **rollups**  are a type of scaling solution that:

  

-   Processes transactions on another blockchain, known as  **Layer 2s**.
-   **Rolls up**  these transactions into batches for inclusion on the main blockchain.

  

#### Benefits:

  

-   **Reduces the load**  on the main blockchain.
-   Makes transactions  **faster and cheaper**.
-   Maintains the  **security**  of the main Layer 1 chain.

  

### Differences Between Optimistic and zk Rollups

  

#### Optimistic Rollups

  

-   **Verification Method**: Use a trust-based model.
    
    -   They are by default  _‘optimistic’_  that the batch sent back to the main blockchain by validators is legitimate.
-   **Challenge Period**:
    
    -   Before the batch is included in the main blockchain, there is a waiting or  _‘challenge’_  period.
    -   During this time, nodes known as  **‘verifiers’**  can review the batches and submit  **‘fraud proofs’**  if any transactions are not valid.
-   **Implementation**:
    
    -   Most popular L2s such as  **Arbitrum**  and  **Optimism**  use this type of rollup.
    -   Easier to implement as most optimistic L2s use a single centralized node called a  **'sequencer'**  which submits these transactions, making them highly scalable.
-   **Setbacks**:
    
    -   **Delays in transaction finality**  due to challenge period (usually up to one week) before users can withdraw their funds.
    -   Use of centralized sequencers may lead to  **censorship and security problems**, though most L2s are looking to gradually decentralize their sequencers.

  

#### zk Rollups

  

-   **Verification Method**: Do not assume the validity of submitted transactions.
    
    -   Prove mathematically that the transactions are legitimate.
    -   Generate  **'validity proofs'**  for each transaction bundle before submission on the main chain.
-   **Benefits**:
    
    -   **No challenge period**  is needed.
    -   **Shorter withdrawal periods**  compared to Optimistic rollups.
    -   Improved  **security and privacy**  due to zero-knowledge proofs.
-   **Setbacks**:
    
    -   Require more  **computational power**, leading to higher transaction costs.
    -   More  **complex**  than optimistic rollups, affecting their flexibility and compatibility with Ethereum, especially in implementing smart contract capabilities.

  

### Which is Better?

  

-   **zk Rollups**  are widely regarded as the endgame of rollup technology by many, including Ethereum’s co-founder  **Vitalik Buterin**.
-   **Vitalik Buterin**  believes that zk Rollups will eventually surpass Optimistic Rollups in the long run.
-   However, zk Rollups are yet to mature and are currently harder to build on.
