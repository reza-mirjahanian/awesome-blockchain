-   We are the core team behind OriginTrail, the open and trusted knowledge foundation for the AI era.

-   Using the open-source Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), we create AI-ready Knowledge Assets and deliver powerful semantic search for businesses and individuals. These assets are built on verified provenance, ownership, and trust, all connected through one global knowledge graph that grows in value with every participant.

-   With partners like Oracle, GS1, British Standards Institution, Swiss Federal Railways, and more, we are driving adoption of cutting-edge solutions across industries --- from healthcare and supply chains to scientific research, construction, and even the metaverse.

The core of the solution is the **Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)**, developed by OriginTrail. You can think of this as a global, shared, and verifiable library of information that AI can use.

Here are the main ideas in simple terms:

* **The Problems with Today's AI**:
    * **Hallucinations**: AI can invent facts because it's essentially guessing based on patterns in the data it was trained on.
    * **Data Ownership & Bias**: AI is often trained on vast amounts of internet data without clear permission, leading to copyright issues and absorbing biases present in that data.
    * **Model Collapse**: If AI models are mostly trained on content created by other AIs, they can start to lose quality and forget important information.

* **The Solution: A Verifiable Internet**:
    * The paper proposes a system where information has a clear origin (provenance) and can be checked to ensure it hasn't been tampered with (verifiability).
    * This is achieved by combining AI with blockchain technology.

* **How It Works**:
    * Information is stored in secure digital containers called **Knowledge Assets**. Each asset is ownable (as an NFT), easily discoverable, and its authenticity can be proven using cryptography.
    * These assets are organized into topic-specific networks called **"paranets"** (e.g., for science, industry, or art).
    * A technique called **Decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG)** allows AI to first search the DKG for verified facts before generating an answer. This makes the AI's responses more accurate and reliable, as they are based on trusted sources.

* **Incentives**:
    * The system uses two cryptocurrencies to encourage people and organizations to contribute high-quality data.
    * **TRAC** is used as the utility token to pay for using the DKG network.
    * **NEURO** is the native token of the NeuroWeb blockchain, used to reward the creation of valuable knowledge and for network governance.

In short, the whitepaper describes a blueprint for a more ethical and reliable AI future, built on a foundation of decentralized, verifiable knowledge.
