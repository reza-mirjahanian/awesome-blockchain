# Dy DX's Upgrade: Moving to a Standalone Blockchain



## Overview of Dy DX's Move
- **Founded in 2017**, Dy DX has announced a significant update: transitioning to their own standalone blockchain.
- **Dy DX Chain**: This move marks a full decentralization effort and a new chapter in one of the largest DeFi derivatives ecosystems.

## Background
- **Previous Setup**: Powered by Ethereum layer 2 StarkWare.
- **June 2022 Announcement**: The intent to move to a native chain built on the Cosmos SDK, allowing for custom blockchain app composition.
- **Objective**: Enhance decentralization and boost performance.

## Key Features of Dy DX Chain
- **Customization**: Full control over the chain and validators.
- **Offchain Order Book System**: Designed to keep latency low and increase throughput.
- **Higher Transaction Volume**: Supports more transactions in an order book format.
- **Decentralization**: Fees distributed to validators and stakers in USDC, with rewards claimed per block to avoid inflation of the native token.

## Governance and Development
- **Governance Community (DAO)**: Comprising stakers, validators, and sub-DAOs.
  - **Operation Sub-DAO**: Monitors chain activity and deploys front-end indexer software.
  - **Grant Sub-DAO**: Facilitates grants to grow the Dy DX Chain ecosystem.

## Post-Genesis Phases
- **Alpha Stage**: Focused on security and stability, with staking across network validators.
- **Beta Stage**: Introduces trading functionality and additional markets, aiming to explore full platform functionality before a full production launch.

## Getting Involved
### Migration Process
1. **Bridge Interface**: Connect an Ethereum wallet holding ETH Dy DX.
2. **Generate Dy DX Chain Address**: Automatically linked to the original Ethereum wallet.
3. **Migrate Tokens**: Enter the amount of ETH Dy DX to migrate, confirm with an Ethereum wallet signature.
4. **Wait for Migration**: Takes roughly 40 hours to receive Dy DX tokens on the Dy DX Chain.

### Staking on Dy DX Chain
1. **Install Kepler Wallet**: Visit kepler.gl and set up using recovery phrase or private key.
2. **Import Recovery Phrase**: Export from the bridge interface and import into Kepler.
3. **Stake Tokens**: Navigate to the staking dashboard, choose validators, and stake tokens. Unstaking requires a 30-day unbonding period.

## Trading on Dy DX Chain
- **Deposit Assets**: From Ethereum wallet to Dy DX chain account via the trading interface.
- **Trading Interface**: Connect wallet, deposit assets, and start trading.

## Benefits of the Move
- **Greater Speed and Scalability**: Customizable and decentralized platform.
- **Enhanced Utility for Dy DX Token**: Governance and staking to promote good protocol behavior.

## Conclusion
- **Future Prospects**: Governed by the DAO, Dy DX aims to move into full trading soon.
- **Commitment to Decentralization**: Continues to solidify its position in DeFi derivatives.
