[Makina](https://makina.finance/)Â introduces a novel framework for onchain asset management that addresses a significant gap in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. While DeFi has successfully replicated many traditional financial primitives, asset management remains underdeveloped, and sophisticated yielding strategies are not broadly available to users across the space. Makina provides a highly adaptable and secure architecture designed to facilitate a broad spectrum of strategies.
