### Core Principles

**Layer Zero's Core Principles:**

-   **Permissionless:** Anyone can interact with Layer Zero.
-   **Censorship Resistance:** No restrictions on interaction.
-   **Immutability:** The protocol will always exist and can be run by any party.

----------

### Functionality

**Layer Zero Protocol:**

-   Not a messaging standard or its own blockchain.
-   Enables communication across blockchains.

**Endpoints:**

-   Immutable smart contracts on both chains.
-   Applications interact with these endpoints to send messages (arbitrary packets of bytes).

----------

### Validation and Execution

**Validation Library:**

-   Append-only, allowing new validation techniques to be added.

**Oracles and Relayers:**

-   Oracles listen for events on one chain and write them to another.
-   Relayers handle gas abstraction and transaction execution.

----------

### V1 vs. V2 Model

**V1 Model:**

-   Every message must be delivered in the exact order it was received.
-   Security and execution tightly coupled.

**V2 Model:**

-   Decoupling of liveness and security.
-   X of Y of N security structure (e.g., 9 out of 15 validators must sign off).
-   Permissionless execution by anyone.

----------

### Practical Challenges

**Challenges:**

-   Running relayers is complex and demanding.
-   Ensuring user-friendly experience without compromising security.

**Horizontal Composability:**

-   Each application has a completed state, improving developer experience and application functionality.

----------

### Security Considerations

**Security Concerns:**

-   Ensuring rails are not corrupted.
-   Maintaining censorship resistance at the packet level.
-   Ensuring immutability to prevent protocol changes.

----------

### Future Outlook

**Importance of Immutability:**

-   Maintaining decentralized and self-sovereign principles.
-   Avoiding privileged positions for broader institutions.

----------

### Conclusion

-   Layer Zero aims to provide a robust, decentralized protocol enabling seamless communication across blockchains while maintaining core principles of permissionless interaction, censorship resistance, and immutability.
