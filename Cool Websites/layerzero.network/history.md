**Why Interoperability?**

* Brian wants to solve hard problems, and interoperability is one of them.
* He started building a bridge between chains, but soon realized that it wasn't just about value transfer, but about generic messaging and arbitrary contract invocation.
* He wants to make it easy for users to interact with different chains without needing to know the underlying technology.

**The Problem with Existing Bridges**

* Brian looked into existing bridges and didn't trust them with his money.
* He started building a better bridge, which eventually became Stargate.


**Why Hasn't it Been Built Before?**

* Brian thinks that it wasn't obvious that interoperability was a problem that needed to be solved until recently.
* He started building a solution 18 months ago, before it became clear that a multi-chain future was possible.

**What is Layer Zero Solving?**

* Layer Zero is solving the problem of generic messaging and arbitrary contract invocation between different chains.
* It's not just about value transfer, but about creating a system that allows for complex contract flows to be executed across multiple chains.
* The goal is to abstract away the underlying technology from the user, so they can interact with different chains seamlessly.

**The Importance of Messaging**

* Brian thinks that messaging is core to what Layer Zero is building.
* He compares it to the internet, which enabled peer-to-peer messaging and information transfer.
* He wants to enable peer-to-peer messaging and value transfer between contracts on different chains.
