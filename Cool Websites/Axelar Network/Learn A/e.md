#### **Section 1: Axelar Network Overview**  
1. **What is the purpose of the Axelar Network Overview dashboard?**  
   *The dashboard provides a high-level view of **network health** and activity, including block production statistics, cross-chain event tracking, and validator performance metrics. Key components include:*  
   - **Block interval times** (average and maximum).  
   - **Validator-specific block proposal frequency**.  
   - **Cross-chain asset/data transfer insights**.  
   - **Signing thresholds** for cryptographic protocols.  

2. **Why is block production data critical for delegators?**  
   *Block production metrics (e.g., interval times) indicate network efficiency. Validators proposing blocks frequently signal reliability, which impacts rewards and penalties for delegators.*

3. **How does Axelar’s quadratic voting system differ from traditional voting power distribution?**  
   *Quadratic voting reduces concentration of power by **weighting votes inversely to validator stake**. For example, a validator with 8% stake under normal voting might only have 4% under quadratic voting, promoting decentralization.*

#### **Section 2: Roles & Responsibilities**  
4. **What is the role of a delegator in Axelar’s network?**  
   *Delegators **stake tokens with validators** to share in rewards/risks. They must:*  
   - Actively monitor validator performance.  
   - Avoid concentration by diversifying stakes.  
   - Redelegate tokens to avoid penalties during validator downtime.  

5. **How do validators differ from those on other Proof-of-Stake networks?**  
   *Axelar validators have **three core responsibilities*:  
   1. Participating in Tendermint consensus.  
   2. Managing multi-party cryptography protocols.  
   3. Voting on cross-chain events (e.g., asset transfers).  

6. **Why is delegation not a “passive” task?**  
   *Delegators must monitor validators for liveness, commission rates, and penalties. Poor validator performance can lead to slashing or lost rewards.*

7. **What risks do delegators share with validators?**  
   *Delegators incur **penalties** (e.g., slashing) if their validator underperforms, misses votes, or is jailed.*

#### **Section 3: Validator Performance Metrics**  
8. **What does “missed blocks” indicate about a validator?**  
   *Validators failing to sign blocks within the Tendermint protocol. Use **time filters** to distinguish isolated incidents vs. chronic issues.*  

9. **How do “missed heartbeats” affect validator rewards?**  
   *Validators must send a heartbeat every 5 minutes to confirm readiness. Missing heartbeats prevents earning rewards until resolved.*  

10. **What is the significance of key generation (key gen) participation?**  
    *Validators must participate in periodic key rotations for security. Low participation signals potential vulnerabilities.*  

11. **How can delegators interpret “signing request success rates”?**  
    *High success rates mean the validator reliably signs cross-chain transfers. Frequent failures may indicate node instability.*  

12. **Why might a validator with a high commission rate still be a good choice?**  
    *High commission rates may reflect costs of maintaining **external chain nodes** (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon). A validator investing in robust infrastructure could justify higher fees.*  

---

#### **Section 4: External Chain Voting & Cross-Chain Events**  
13. **What are the consequences of a validator voting “no” on cross-chain transfers?**  
   *If the “no” vote aligns with the majority, rewards are earned. Voting against the majority forfeits rewards.*  

14. **How does the dashboard visualize validator voting participation?**  
   *A **heatmap** uses color gradients (dark purple = full participation, white = no participation) to show voting consistency over time.*  

15. **Why compare a validator’s “no vote ratio” to the network average?**  
   *A validator’s ratio significantly higher than the network suggests they’re frequently disagreeing with the majority, possibly due to node misconfigurations.*  

16. **What causes abstentions in cross-chain voting?**  
   *Abstentions occur when a validator’s external chain node is offline or unsynced, preventing participation.*  

17. **How can delegators troubleshoot validator abstentions?**  
   *Check the **external chain breakdown** (e.g., Polygon-specific issues) and compare with other validators. Widespread abstentions suggest network-wide problems.*

#### **Section 5: Using the Mexico Dashboard**  
18. **How can delegators filter validator performance data effectively?**  
   *Use **time range filters** to assess long-term trends vs. short-term anomalies (e.g., missed blocks over 30 days vs. 24 hours).*  

19. **What does the “total delegation” metric signify?**  
   *High delegation counts indicate community trust in the validator. However, over-concentration risks centralization.*  

20. **How does the “redelegate” function benefit delegators?**  
   *Redelegating avoids the **lock-up period** for unstaking, allowing immediate token transfers between validators.*  

21. **What does a validator’s “jailed” status mean?**  
   *Jailing occurs after repeated liveness failures. It’s a protective measure to allow validators time to resolve issues without accruing penalties.*  

22. **How can delegators use the “registered voting networks” data?**  
   *Validators must run nodes on external chains (e.g., Ethereum). This metric confirms their operational scope and potential points of failure.*  

---

#### **Section 6: Risk Management & Strategy**  
23. **Why is diversifying stakes across multiple validators recommended?**  
   *Mitigates risk of slashing from a single validator’s failure. Also reduces stake concentration, improving network decentralization.*  

24. **What factors should delegators prioritize beyond commission rates?**  
   - **Liveness metrics** (missed blocks/heartbeats).  
   - Cross-chain voting consistency.  
   - Transparency in node infrastructure.  

25. **How can delegators identify recovering validators after downtime?**  
   *Check the **latest 1-hour no vote ratio**. A drop to 0% indicates resolved issues.*  

26. **What actions should a delegator take if their validator is jailed?**  
   *Redelegate tokens immediately to avoid prolonged penalties. Monitor the validator’s status for resolution updates.*  

27. **How does quadratic voting protect against malicious actors?**  
   *By reducing the influence of large stakeholders, it limits the ability to manipulate cross-chain voting outcomes.*

#### **Section 7: Advanced Insights**  
28. **How do external chain node issues impact validator performance?**  
   *Node downtime on chains like Polygon can cause missed votes/abstentions, reducing rewards and triggering penalties.*  

29. **What does the “same votes” column in the validator drill-down indicate?**  
   *Shows how many validators voted identically. High counts suggest systemic issues (e.g., Polygon bugs), not individual failures.*  

30. **Why monitor delegation and stake trends over time?**  
   *Increasing delegation signals growing trust, while sudden drops may indicate unreported validator issues.*  

31. **How do signing thresholds affect network security?**  
   *Thresholds define the minimum validator participation required for cross-chain operations. Higher thresholds enhance security but reduce flexibility.*  

32. **What is the relationship between stake and voting power in Tendermint?**  
   *Voting power is proportional to stake. Larger stakes increase block proposal frequency and consensus influence.*

36. **What steps can validators take to reduce missed heartbeats?**  
   *Implement automated monitoring/alerting systems and redundant node configurations.*  

---

#### **Section 9: Hypothetical Scenarios**  
37. **A validator has a 10% commission rate but 0 missed blocks. Is this a good choice?**  
   *Possibly. The high rate may reflect infrastructure costs. Compare with validators offering lower commissions but similar reliability.*  

38. **A validator’s “abstain” votes are rising. What could this mean?**  
   *Potential node issues on specific external chains (e.g., Polygon). Check the “external chain breakdown” for patterns.*  

39. **A delegator notices a validator’s stake dropping rapidly. What should they do?**  
   *Investigate recent performance metrics (e.g., missed votes) and consider redelegating to avoid penalties.*  

40. **A validator votes “no” on 30% of cross-chain transfers. Is this problematic?**  
   *Compare to the network average. If the network’s no vote ratio is 5%, this validator may have misconfigured nodes.*  

---

#### **Section 10: Future Considerations**  
41. **How might Axelar’s validator requirements evolve?**  
   *Increasing cross-chain integrations may demand more robust node infrastructure, raising commission rates for reliable validators.*  

42. **What role could AI/automation play in delegator decision-making?**  
   *Tools could auto-redelegate based on performance thresholds or alert delegators about emerging validator risks.*  

43. **How can delegators contribute to network decentralization?**  
   *By staking with smaller validators and avoiding over-concentration in top stakeholders.*  

---

#### **Section 11: Closing Insights**  
44. **Why is Axelar’s multi-chain focus unique for validators?**  
   *Validators must maintain expertise across multiple ecosystems (e.g., Ethereum, Cosmos, Polygon), increasing operational complexity.*  

45. **What is the long-term impact of quadratic voting on Axelar?**  
   *Promotes decentralization by limiting large validators’ influence, fostering a more resilient network.*  

46. **How does Metric’s dashboard improve transparency for delegators?**  
   *Provides granular, real-time data on validator performance, cross-chain voting, and network health.*  

47. **What is the #1 mistake new delegators make?**  
   *Choosing validators solely based on low commission rates, ignoring liveness and voting metrics.*  

48. **How can delegators stay updated on validator changes?**  
   *Monitor dashboard alerts, join Metric’s Discord, and subscribe to Axelar network announcements.*  

49. **What ethical considerations exist for validators?**  
   *Validators must balance profit motives with network health (e.g., avoiding excessive commission hikes).*  

50. **How does Axelar’s penalty system compare to other PoS networks?**  
   *Jailing mechanisms allow validators time to recover without immediate slashing, reducing punitive severity.*  

51. **What is the ultimate goal of the Mexico dashboard?**
