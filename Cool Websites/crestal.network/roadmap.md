**Crestal Dashboard**

*   We are developing an analytics module to ensure all modular services metrics are continuously collected and saved. This will be the backbone of our observability platform.
*   The Crestal Metric SDK will enable decentralized metrics collection, allowing both in-house and third-party nodes to contribute data.
*   Our processing capabilities will handle all metrics, ensuring a comprehensive view of performance and operations.

**More Modular Categories**

-   Beyond Data Availability (DA), we plan to support more categories, broadening the scope of our platform.

**Crestal Assistant**

-   The Crestal AI Assistant will engage with builders, discussing specific needs and breaking down requirements to derive concrete, desired performance metrics.

**Intent Solver Network**

-   We will release a centralized  **Solver** to propose custom Web3 architecture based on builder requirements.
-   A network of decentralized  **Solvers** will be then supported, creating a competitive market for the best Web3 project designs.
-   Builders will be able to select proposals from  **Solvers**, with detailed instructions and costs included in the proposals

**Worker Network**

-   Accepted proposals will be sent to Crestal’s network of  **Workers** for deployment.
-   **Workers** will execute deployments based on  **Solver**  designs, showcasing that the services are up and running.
-   **Builders** can then integrate these deployed services into their business logic seamlessly.

**Crestal Worker SDK**

-   An SDK for  **Workers** to run and set up services will be built and open for contributions, enhancing the flexibility and utility of our platform.

**Proof of Performance (PoP)**

-   **Workers** will generate  **PoP**s after setting up the services, ensuring verifiable performance and reliability.

**Incentivization**

-   Clear incentives will be established for all roles involved in running operations, ensuring motivation and fairness.
-   Incentive rules will be fine-tuned through governance votes, allowing the community to have a say in the platform’s evolution.

**Tokenomics**

-   We will release full tokenomics, complete with simulations to demonstrate potential outcomes and benefits, ensuring transparency and trust.
