The Problem[​](https://docs.mantis.app/concepts/learn#the-problem "Direct link to The Problem")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A cross-domain intent protocol like Mantis has become relevant due to several key issues facing the DeFi space:

-   **Poor user experience (UX):** Decentralized applications are often not intuitive. Cross-chain operations exacerbate this problem as they typically require a user to navigate between multiple different applications and networks.
-   **Suboptimal earnings opportunities:** When a user is not actively using an asset in an account, it typically does not earn yield. This is poor capital efficiency. Moreover, the massive expanse of DeFi makes it hard for users to identify optimal opportunities.
-   **Centralization trends:** Decentralization provides a trust-minimized environment. This means that there is no reliance on a third party to behave a certain way. As a result, decentralized structures are more secure, transparent, and resilient to attacks or failures. However, there have been recent trends towards centralization in the multi-chain pipeline, including centralized bridges. Yet, existing decentralized solutions do not rival existing centralized structures in terms of speed or cost.

Now, new technologies are being introduced that help solve these problems. This includes trust-minimized bridging structures like [Picasso](http://picasso.xyz/). These developments enable generalized message passing and synchronization of protocols and applications across multiple blockchain ecosystems.


**Understanding Intents**

Intents have become a hot topic in DeFi. In general, intents are understood to be users' desires for a given transaction or other outcome. Intents include desired parameters such as to swap X amount of A token for B token. But, intents also leave some room for flexibility such as where this swap occurs.

Anoma does a great job of breaking down the history and various definitions of intents in [this blog](https://anoma.net/blog/intents-arent-real) about their Intents Day event. [This blog](https://blog.essential.builders/introducing-essential/) by Essential also provides another means of defining intents and solvers.
