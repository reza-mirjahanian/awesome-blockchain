[Mantis](https://www.mantis.app/) is a vertically integrated intent pipeline complete with expression, execution, and settlement. This is accomplished via the Mantis protocol and Mantis rollup.


Mantis synergizes with the [Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) Protocol](https://www.ibcprotocol.dev/) via the [Picasso Network](https://www.picasso.network/) to deliver secure interoperability. Ultimately, Mantis strives to establish a decentralized market for cross-domain intent expression.


## intent
-   **Generalized intents:** An intent is an expression of what a user wants to achieve whenever they interact with a protocol, for instance "transfer X from A to B" or "trade X for Y". Practically, an intent is an off-chain signed message that encodes which state transitions a user wants to achieve. Unlike transactions, intents are partial, so one can think of intents as parts of transactions that require other direct or indirect parts as complements in order to form a final balanced transaction which satisfies all users' constraints (Goes, 2022). Intents are a promising solution for improving user experience and outcomes.
