## Historical Context and Evolution

### 1. Merge Mining
- **Origin**: Concept in Bitcoin
- **Process**: Mining Bitcoin chain while also mining other chains
- **Problem**: "Nothing at stake" issue, leading to attacks on secondary chains

### 2. Proof of Stake (PoS)
- **Improvement**: Introduced the concept of having something "at stake"
- **Benefit**: Prevents attacks that were possible in merge mining

### 3. Traditional Staking
- **Example**: Ethereum network
- **Process**: Locking up 32 ETH and delegating it to nodes
- **Purpose**: Validators promise to uphold the network
- **Risk**: Slashing if duties are not fulfilled

### 4. Liquid Staking
- **Evolution**: Delegating staking responsibility to third parties
- **Examples**: Lido, Rocket Pool, Frax, etc.
- **Benefit**: Easier participation for most people

## Restaking Explained

### Definition
Restaking is the evolution from traditional staking, involving taking assets from a base network and restaking them to other applications or protocols around the main protocol.

### Types of Restaking

1. **Standard Restaking**
   - Uses liquid staking derivatives or ERC20 tokens
   - Process:
     1. Take economic asset (e.g., staked ETH, USDC)
     2. Point it to a restaking contract (e.g., EigenLayer)
     3. Node operator restakes to different Active Validator Services (AVS)

2. **Native Restaking**
   - Uses 32 ETH directly
   - Restakes entire validator to a node operator
   - More powerful but riskier

### Importance of Restaking
- Opens up a "blue ocean" of new applications and use cases
- Creates a new DeFi primitive
- Enables building:
  - New forms of asset management
  - AI interfaces
  - New types of bridges
  - Keeper networks
  - On-chain and off-chain applications

## Active Validator Services (AVS)
- Applications built on top of restaking
- Examples: Bridges, Keeper Bots, Asset Management

## Yield Nest's Role
- A liquid restaking protocol
- Wraps around different restaking protocols
- Aims to remove complexities of restaking
- Makes any restake position liquid

## Key Takeaways
1. Restaking is exporting crypto-economic security to different applications
2. It's an evolving concept with multiple potential protocols
3. Current architecture involves reakers, node operators, and AVS
4. Yield from restaking may take time to materialize fully
