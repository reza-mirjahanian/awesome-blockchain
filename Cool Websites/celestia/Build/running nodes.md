Celestia node operators can run several options on the network.

Consensus:

-   [Validator node](https://docs.celestia.org/how-to-guides/validator-node): This type of node participates in consensus by producing and voting on blocks.
-   [Consensus node](https://docs.celestia.org/how-to-guides/consensus-node): A celestia-app full node to sync blockchain history.

Data Availability:

-   [Bridge node](https://docs.celestia.org/how-to-guides/bridge-node): This node bridges blocks between the Data-Availability network and the Consensus network.
-   [Full storage node](https://docs.celestia.org/how-to-guides/full-storage-node): This node stores all the data but does not connect to Consensus.
-   [Light node](https://docs.celestia.org/how-to-guides/light-node): Light clients conduct data availability sampling on the Data Availability network.
