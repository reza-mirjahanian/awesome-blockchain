#### Summary

-   Modular blockchains prioritize decentralization for network security by reducing the cost for users to operate nodes and verify the network.
-   Scaling enables modular blockchains to increase capacity without making it costly for users to verify and secure the network.
-   A decentralized network of users are ultimately responsible for upholding the security of a blockchain in the presence of malicious validators.
-   

#### Scalability

As users increase, blockchains must also increase the number of transactions they can process. However, increasing the number of transactions a blockchain processes increases the amount of work required to verify the chain. If it becomes more difficult to verify the chain, then less people can run nodes and the blockchain becomes more centralized.

Transaction throughput measures how many transactions a blockchain can process, commonly referred to as transactions per second (TPS). To scale, a blockchain must increase the number of transactions it can process without an equal increase in the cost to operate a secure node.
