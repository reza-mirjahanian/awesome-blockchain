You can launch your chain as easily as a smart contract with Celestia underneath. Here's how you can start:

-   Deploy fast with an [Ethereum L2 using leading rollup frameworks](https://celestia.org/build/#build).
-   Transform nearly any VM into its [own sovereign chains](https://celestia.org/build/#build).
-   One-click deployment on managed infrastructure using a [Rollups-as-a-Service provider](https://celestia.org/deploy/).

#### To sum it all up

-   Data availability is a core scaling bottleneck for crypto applications and is the vast majority of costs that rollups and Layer 2s pay.
-   Data availability is about proving that data was published by allowing anyone to download it for a short period of time.
-   A DA layer is a blockchain that rollups and L2s publish their transaction data to.
-   Celestia's DA layer eliminates data availability as a core scaling bottleneck, dropping costs for developers by ~95% and enabling them to build fully-onchain apps.
