A perpetual swap is a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the price of an underlying asset *without an expiration date*. Unlike traditional futures contracts, which have a set expiry, perpetual swaps can be held indefinitely, hence the term "perpetual." They mimic the experience of holding a spot position but with the added benefits of leverage and trading without owning the underlying asset.

Here's a breakdown of key characteristics and how they work:

1.  **No Expiration Date:** This is the defining feature. You can hold a position for as long as you like, provided you maintain sufficient margin. This eliminates the need to roll over contracts as you would with futures.

2.  **Funding Rate:** Since perpetual swaps don't have an expiry, a mechanism called the *funding rate* is used to tether the contract price to the underlying spot market price. This periodic payment is exchanged between long and short positions.

    -   **If the funding rate is positive:** Longs pay shorts. This typically happens when the perpetual swap price is above the spot price, incentivizing traders to go short and bring the price down.

    -   **If the funding rate is negative:** Shorts pay longs. This typically happens when the perpetual swap price is below the spot price, incentivizing traders to go long and push the price up.

3.  **Leverage:** Perpetual swaps allow traders to use leverage, meaning they can control a larger position with a smaller initial investment. While this magnifies potential profits, it also amplifies potential losses. High leverage can lead to liquidation if the market moves against your position.

4.  **Margin Trading:** Trading perpetual swaps involves margin, a good-faith deposit required to open and maintain a leveraged position. If the market moves unfavorably and your margin falls below a certain threshold (the maintenance margin), your position will be liquidated to prevent further losses.

5.  **Settlement in Cryptocurrency (Usually):** Most perpetual swap contracts are settled in a cryptocurrency, often the quote currency of the trading pair (e.g., USDT, USDC).

**How Perpetual Swaps Work in Practice:**

Imagine you believe the price of Bitcoin will rise. You could buy a perpetual swap contract on Bitcoin. If the price goes up, your position profits. You can hold this position as long as you maintain the required margin. Periodically, you'll either pay or receive the funding rate depending on the market conditions.

**Key Differences from Futures Contracts:**

-   **Expiration:** Perpetual swaps have no expiration date, while futures contracts do.
-   **Settlement:** Futures contracts can be physically settled (delivery of the underlying asset), while perpetual swaps are typically cash-settled in cryptocurrency.
-   **Funding Rate:** Perpetual swaps use a funding rate mechanism, which is absent in traditional futures.

**Risks of Trading Perpetual Swaps:**

-   **Liquidation Risk:** High leverage can lead to significant losses and liquidation if the market moves against your position.
-   **Funding Rate Risk:** While the funding rate can be a source of income, it can also be a cost if it moves against your position.
-   **Market Volatility:** Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, which can lead to rapid price swings and increased risk.
