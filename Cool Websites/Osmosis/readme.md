https://app.osmosis.zone/


Osmosis is a leading cross-chain DeFi hub and the primary trading venue for the Cosmos ecosystem. It acts as the gateway to the interchain, connecting over 50 blockchains and facilitating access to a wide range of appchains. As IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) continues to expand, Osmosis positions itself as the central platform for new users, developers, and protocols entering the "Internet of Blockchains."

The Osmosis ecosystem encompasses a suite of DAO-gated dApps that are tightly integrated with its AMMs (Automated Market Makers) and IBC routing capabilities. Numerous developers are building innovative applications, including index tokens, options, perpetual swaps, stop/limit orders, automated trading, yield vaults, and NFTs. With continuous development and the introduction of features like stableswap, concentrated liquidity, rate-limiting, and in-protocol MEV capture, Osmosis is solidifying its position as a full-service, cross-chain exchange and DeFi hub.

### Key Features of Osmosis:

-   **Cross-chain DeFi Hub:**  Osmosis connects diverse blockchains through IBC, enabling interoperability and seamless asset transfer.
-   **Customizable Liquidity Pools:**  Unlike traditional AMMs with limited customization, Osmosis empowers users to adjust parameters like swap fees and bonding curves, optimizing market efficiency.
-   **AMM as Serviced Infrastructure:**  Osmosis provides a flexible platform for developers to easily create efficient AMMs tailored to specific financial instruments, simplifying the process of building customized market makers.

Osmosis aims to offer the user-friendly experience of centralized exchanges while retaining the benefits of decentralized finance, including self-custody, trust-minimized transactions, on-chain access, and privacy.
