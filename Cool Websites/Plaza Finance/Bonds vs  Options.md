## Bonds & Options


 bonds and options are both widely available from brokers and can both be used as part of an investment strategy, although they actually have very different characteristics. The fact that they are **both a form of contract**, though, can result in people mistakenly believing that they are the same thing.   A frequently asked question is “What are the differences between options and bonds?” 
 
 


### Options

**Definition**: An option is a financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price within a specified time period.

**Types**:
1. **Call Option**: Gives the holder the right to buy an asset.
2. **Put Option**: Gives the holder the right to sell an asset.

**Example**:
- Imagine you think Company A's stock price will rise in the next month. You buy a **call option** to purchase 100 shares of Company A at $50 per share within the next month. If the stock price rises to $60, you can buy at $50 and sell at $60, making a profit. If the stock price stays below $50, you can let the option expire, only losing the **premium** you paid for the option.

### Bonds

**Definition**: A bond is a fixed income instrument representing a loan made by an investor to a borrower (typically corporate or governmental). Bonds have a defined term/maturity date, at which point the principal is repaid along with interest (coupons).

**Example**:
- Suppose you buy a bond from Company B with a face value of $1,000, an annual interest rate of 5%, and a maturity of 5 years. You lend $1,000 to Company B. Each year, you receive $50 in interest (5% of $1,000). After 5 years, Company B pays you back the $1,000 principal.

### Key Differences

1. **Purpose**:
   - **Options**: Used for speculation or hedging.
   - **Bonds**: Used for raising capital and earning fixed interest.

2. **Obligation**:
   - **Options**: No obligation to exercise the option.
   - **Bonds**: Obligation to repay the principal with interest.

3. **Risk**:
   - **Options**: Higher risk and potential for higher return.
   - **Bonds**: Lower risk and typically lower return.

4. **Income**:
   - **Options**: No regular income; potential profit from price movements.
   - **Bonds**: Regular income through interest payments.

### Simple Example Comparison

**Option Example**:
- You buy a call option for $10 to buy 100 shares of Company A at $50 each.
- If Company A's stock price goes to $60, you can exercise the option and buy at $50, then sell at $60 for a profit.
- If the stock stays below $50, you let the option expire, losing only the $10 premium.

**Bond Example**:
- You buy a $1,000 bond from Company B with a 5% annual interest rate.
- Each year, you receive $50 in interest.
- After 5 years, you get back your $1,000 principal.

Options are more about betting on price movements, while bonds are about lending money for a steady return.
