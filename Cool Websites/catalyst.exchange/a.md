### Chain Abstraction

-   **Definition:** A method to simplify user interaction with multiple blockchains.
-   **Current State:**
    -   There are many different chains (e.g., Ethereum, Cosmos).
    -   Users face confusion in choosing chains.
-   **Goal:**
    -   Create a middle layer that abstracts complexity.
    -   Expose only necessary information to users and developers.

### Solvers

-   **Definition:** Agents that help users express their desires (e.g., earning yield).
-   **Function:** Implement user requests through various transactions across chains.
-   **Role:** Act as intermediaries, facilitating user interactions with blockchain networks.

Technology Adoption Phase
-------------------------

-   **Historical Context:**
    -   In 2017, the belief was that everything would run on a single chain (Ethereum).
    -   Current understanding: a multi-blockchain ecosystem is emerging.
-   **Evolution of Web Technologies:**
    -   Comparison between Web 1, Web 2, and Web 3.
    -   Need for standardization in Web 3 similar to the evolution seen in Web 2.

Catalyst's Role
---------------

### Overview

-   **Functionality:** Catalyst unifies liquidity across different chains.
-   **Benefit:**
    -   New blockchains can access liquidity without needing to create their own.
    -   Reduces fragmentation and enhances capital efficiency.

### Implementation

-   **Components of Catalyst:**
    1.  **Vaults:** Where assets are stored.
    2.  **Value Coordination System:** Allows access to assets across chains (state synchronization).
    3.  **Data Communication System:** Utilizes interoperability protocols (e.g., Layer Zero, Wormhole, IBC).

### Liquidity Providers

-   **Types of Depositors:**
    -   **Retail Users:** General public.
    -   **Institutional Investors:** Hedge funds and liquid funds.
    -   **Chains Themselves:** Chains front their own liquidity to bootstrap pools.

Analogy for Catalyst
--------------------

-   **Currency Exchange Analogy:**
    -   Catalyst likened to a currency exchange for blockchains.
    -   Facilitates trade agreements between chains, similar to how countries manage currency exchanges.

Automated Market Maker (AMM) Discussion
---------------------------------------

-   **Role of AMM:**
    -   Facilitates value coordination between assets.
    -   Currently operates in a simple form in Catalyst's V1 stage.
-   **Future Considerations:**
    -   Exploration of generalizing the AMM functionality.
    -   Solvers may provide liquidity without necessarily relying on the AMM.
