-   **The first idea:**
    -   To develop yield-generating products that are:
        -   **Safe**
        -   Based on the **US Dollar**
        -   Capable of providing **above-market yields**.

-  **Sedond idea:**
creation of **Stable Jack** and its unique focus on:
    -   *Yield on volatility tokenization.*
    -   *The points market and points trading.*


    Stable Jack generally does not impose maturity dates (expires) for its points farming—users can exit or reposition anytime, improving flexibility and safety.
