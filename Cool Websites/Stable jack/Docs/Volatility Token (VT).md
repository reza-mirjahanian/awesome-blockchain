### What is the Volatility Token?

Volatility Token (VT) is a token that offers leverage exposure to the collateral asset without liquidation risk. It mirrors the price volatility of the collateral asset similar to leveraged contracts, but without funding fees or liquidation risk.

The main features of the Volatility Token can be summarized as:

-   The Volatility Token enables users to have leveraged long exposure to collateral assets **without the risk of liquidation** so that users are not affected by **sudden price spikes or market volatility.**

-   The Volatility Token offers the **cheapest way** to achieve long exposure to any asset.

-   Being tokenized, it can also be **used as collateral** in DeFi protocols.

-   Volatility Token holders can **outperform the returns of the underlying collateral asset**, which is a primary goal for most asset managers.

-   Volatility Token holders **don't pay** **any funding fees.**

**Note:** Every collateral asset will have a unique Volatility Token.
