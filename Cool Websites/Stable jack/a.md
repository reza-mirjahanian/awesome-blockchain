# **Inspiration Behind Stable Jack: Solving DeFi Pain Points**

* **Identifying Critical Gaps in the DeFi Market:**
    * **Primary Motivator 1: The Luna Crash**
        * *Key Insight*: Demonstrated a strong user demand for **consistent, above-market yields**, but underscored the absolute necessity for these yields to be ***safe***.
        * While not personally affected, the founder recognized the widespread impact on the community.
    * **Primary Motivator 2: The USDC Depeg**
        * *Key Insight*: Revealed the deep reliance on stablecoins and the severe negative consequences for users when stablecoin stability is compromised.
* **The Core Objective:**
    * To develop yield-generating products that are:
        * **Safe**
        * Based on the **US Dollar**
        * Capable of providing **above-market yields**.
* **Evolution of the Idea:**
    * **Initial Concept:**
        * A synthetic dollar project backed by **funding rate arbitrage**, similar in nature to Ethena Labs.
        * This concept was explored *before* it gained widespread popularity.
    * **Challenges with Initial Concept:**
        * Skepticism from the market regarding the use of centralized exchanges for necessary hedges.
        * Difficulties in securing funding and support.
    * **The Strategic Pivot:**
        * The team decided to pivot from the original synthetic dollar idea.
        * This pivot led directly to the creation of **Stable Jack** and its unique focus on:
            * *Yield on volatility tokenization.*
            * *The points market and points trading.*

# **Yield & Volatility Tokenization Explained**

* **Core Concept:** The fundamental idea is to *disaggregate an asset into its core components*, such as underlying price exposure, yield, and associated points (like airdrop points or loyalty points), and allow users to selectively gain exposure to these components.

* **Analogy: The "Basket" Method (using Ethena's sUSDe as an Example)**
    * Consider Ethena's sUSDe, which inherently possesses two main attributes:
        * A **yield** (e.g., ~10% APY).
        * **Points** from Ethena Labs (for potential airdrops or other benefits).
    * **The Mechanism:**
        1.  Users deposit their sUSDe into a common pool, or "basket."
        2.  This basket now contains the collective yield and points from all deposited sUSDe.
        3.  Users can then choose which component they wish to specialize in:
            * **User A (Yield Seeker):** Opts to receive all the yield from the basket. This includes their own sUSDe's yield *plus* the yield contributed by other users (like User B) who chose points.
            * **User B (Points Seeker):** Opts to receive all the points from the basket. This includes points from their own sUSDe *plus* the points contributed by other users (like User A) who chose yield.
    * **The Outcome:**
        * **User A** achieves *leveraged yield* (e.g., if User B also contributed, User A might get double their inherent yield).
        * **User B** achieves *leveraged points exposure* (e.g., double their inherent points).

* **Extending to Yield and Price Volatility:**
    * The same principle applies to an asset's yield and its price volatility (its upward or downward price movement).
    * **The Mechanism:**
        1.  The asset's yield component and its volatility component are conceptually placed into the "basket."
        2.  **User X (Yield Seeker):** Can choose to take the combined yield, effectively earning a *leveraged yield* on their stablecoin (USD) deposit.
        3.  **User Y (Volatility Seeker):** Can choose to take the combined price volatility exposure. This allows them to gain a ***leveraged long position on the underlying asset (e.g., a blue-chip crypto) without the risk of liquidation and without paying funding fees.***

# **Where Do the Enhanced Yields Come From?**

* **Clarification on Yield Source:**
    * The enhanced yields are **NOT** generated through:
        * *Rehypothecation* of user assets.
        * Investing users' money into *external, often riskier, protocols* to chase higher yields.
* **The True Source: A Peer-to-Peer Exchange of Asset Components:**
    * Yields (and leveraged exposure to other components like points or volatility) are derived from a **direct exchange between users** based on their individual preferences.
* **Illustrative Example (Ethena sUSDe - Yield vs. Points):**
    * Assume:
        * User 1 has 1 sUSDe (generating, for instance, 10% APY and X Ethena points).
        * User 2 has 1 sUSDe (also generating 10% APY and X Ethena points).
    * **The Exchange Agreement:**
        * User 1 desires more Ethena points and is willing to forgo their sUSDe's yield.
        * User 2 desires more yield from sUSDe and is willing to forgo their Ethena points.
    * **The Transaction:**
        * User 1 gives their sUSDe's yield entitlement (10%) to User 2.
        * User 2 gives their Ethena points entitlement (X points) to User 1.
    * **The Result:**
        * **User 1 (Points Focused):** Now effectively has **2X Ethena points exposure** (their own X + User 2's X) from their single sUSDe, but receives 0% yield from it.
        * **User 2 (Yield Focused):** Now effectively earns **20% APY** (their own 10% + User 1's 10%) on their single sUSDe, but receives 0 Ethena points from it.
    * *This voluntary exchange creates leveraged exposure to the desired asset component (yield or points) for each participant.*

# **Game Changer: Principal Protection in Leveraged Points Farming**

* **The Common Pitfall in Traditional Leveraged Points Protocols:**
    * Many existing protocols offering leveraged points exposure often incorporate **maturity dates**.
    * A significant risk is that at the maturity date, if a user has opted for leveraged points, their ***initial principal investment can depreciate to zero***, especially if the points do not accrue substantial value or the market for them is unfavorable.
    * This creates a *highly risky scenario* because the future value of points is inherently uncertain, potentially leading to considerable financial losses for users.

* **Stable Jack's Innovative Approach: The "Pool Model" (vs. Tranche Model)**
    * Revisiting the "basket" analogy: Users contribute components to a pool.
    * ***Crucial Distinction***: When participating in points farming on Stable Jack, users **do not deposit their actual principal into the speculative basket.** Instead, they only contribute the *points component* generated by their underlying collateral asset.
    * **The Direct Benefit**: Since users **retain their principal asset**, it remains protected irrespective of the eventual market value or outcome of the farmed points.

* **Additional Advantages of Stable Jack's Model:**
    * **No Maturity Dates:** Unlike many other protocols, Stable Jack's points farming (and other products) generally do not have fixed maturity dates, further enhancing principal safety and user flexibility.
    * **Potential for Collateralization:** Because the principal-protected tokens still represent a claim on an underlying asset (minus its points/yield depending on the product), they open up possibilities for use as **collateral in DeFi lending markets**. This could allow users to further lever up their positions or borrow against their holdings.
    * ***The Core Innovation***: This principal protection is achieved by fundamentally **separating the user's principal from the specific component (e.g., points) they are choosing to speculate on or exchange.**

---

# **Diverse Collaterals, Diverse Opportunities on Stable Jack**

* **Current Collateral Types Supported:**
    * **1. Stablecoins:**
        * *Ideal For*: Users who anticipate market consolidation (choppy price action) or bearish (negative) trends and prefer to hold USD-pegged assets.
        * *Strategy*: Instead of letting stablecoins sit idle, put them to work on Stable Jack.
        * *User Choices*:
            * **Points Maximization**: If bullish on a specific points program associated with a strategy, opt for leveraged points exposure.
            * **Enhanced Yield**: If preferring a solid, predictable return, opt for a **leveraged yield token** on top of their stablecoins.
    * **2. Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs):**
        * *Current Availability*: Supported on **Avalanche (AVAX)** and **Sonic** ecosystems.
        * *Example (Sonic LSDs)*:
            * **Yield Focus**: Users can obtain *leveraged Sonic staking yield* while still maintaining their underlying exposure to the Sonic network's native asset. This is attractive for those bullish on the Sonic ecosystem's long-term growth. *"It's like holding Sonic with steroids."*
            * **Points/Airdrop Focus**: If users believe a Sonic-related airdrop is imminent and potentially valuable, they can opt for the **Sonic Points Token**. This provides *leveraged exposure to the anticipated airdrop, crucially with principal protection.*
* **Featured Product: Yield vs. Volatility (Example: Avalanche - AVAX)**
    * **Unique Opportunity**: Enables users to take a **long position on AVAX (or other supported assets) *without any risk of liquidation and without incurring ongoing funding fees.***
    * *Proven Track Record*: This specific product has been live for approximately 10 months (as of the interview).
        * During this period, **no Stable Jack users utilizing this product have been liquidated.**
        * Users have **not paid any funding fees** for holding these leveraged long positions.
    * *Market Significance*: This positions Stable Jack as offering one of the ***safest and potentially cheapest methods to gain leveraged long exposure*** to assets like AVAX.
    * *User Behavior*: Some users have maintained their leveraged long positions for nearly 10 months, a feat rarely seen in traditional leveraged trading due to liquidation risks or the high cost of funding fees over extended periods.

# **Understanding Funding Fees (And Why Stable Jack Users Can Avoid Them)**

* **Definition of Funding Fees:**
    * *Funding fees* are periodic payments exchanged between traders holding long and short leveraged positions in perpetual futures contracts or similar derivatives on centralized and decentralized exchanges.
    * They are a mechanism to keep the derivative's price anchored to the underlying asset's spot price.
    * Typically, if longs outnumber shorts and the derivative price is above spot, longs pay shorts. If shorts outnumber longs and the derivative price is below spot, shorts pay longs.

* **Key Characteristics of Funding Fees:**
    * **Highly Variable:** The funding rate can fluctuate dramatically based on market sentiment, leverage demand, and price discrepancies. It can range from very high positive rates (e.g., equivalent to over 1000% APR paid by longs) to negative rates (e.g., -50% APR, where shorts pay longs).
    * **Potentially Very Costly:** For traders aiming to hold leveraged positions for an extended duration, accumulating funding fees can significantly erode profits or exacerbate losses.

* **Stable Jack's Advantage – Bypassing Traditional Funding Fees:**
    * Stable Jack's products, particularly the yield vs. volatility offerings (e.g., liquidation-free long on AVAX), are structured as a **bilateral exchange of pre-defined asset components** (e.g., one user takes all the yield, the other takes all the price volatility).
    * This structure **does not rely on traditional leverage contracts** that necessitate funding fee payments.
    * **Benefit for Users**: This allows for the creation and maintenance of *long-term leveraged positions without the continuous financial drain associated with funding fees*, making such strategies more viable and cost-effective.

# **Democratizing Sophisticated Strategies: The Curated Pairs System**

* **Concept Overview:**
    * The **Curated Pairs** system is designed to make sophisticated investment strategies, typically accessible only to a select few, available to a broader audience.
    * It draws parallels to concepts like DeFi vaults or specialized lending pools (e.g., inspired by models like Morpho's peer-to-peer layer on lending markets).
    * In this system, **third-party managers** – who could be skilled individual investors, arbitrage specialists, or automated bots – function as ***yield creators***.

* **How Curated Pairs Work:**
    1.  **Strategy Definition:** Curators (third-party managers) define a specific investment strategy.
    2.  **Fund Management:** They manage the funds deposited by users according to this predefined strategy.
    3.  **Objective:** The primary goal of the curator is to generate the **highest possible yield** for the depositors.
        * *Incentive Alignment*: Curators are typically incentivized by earning a percentage of the profits generated, meaning their success is directly tied to the success of their users.

* **Stable Jack's Unique Role: Tokenization and User Choice:**
    * Stable Jack takes these positions managed by curators and **tokenizes them**.
    * This tokenization provides depositors (users) with distinct choices regarding how they want to receive their returns:
        * **Option 1: Fixed Yield**
            * *Target User*: Individuals seeking **predictable returns** and peace of mind, irrespective of short-term market volatility or nuanced fluctuations in the curator's performance (within the bounds of the strategy's viability).
            * *Example*: A user might opt for a guaranteed 10% APY. They know what they will earn, offering stability.
        * **Option 2: Leveraged Yield**
            * *Target User*: Individuals who are confident in a specific curator's expertise and believe market conditions will be favorable to that curator's strategy.
            * *Potential Outcome*: The possibility of achieving ***outsized returns***. For instance, if the curator's strategy yields 10%, a user opting for leveraged yield might receive 15%, 20%, or even more, depending on the leverage factor.
            * This can offer *asymmetric risk-reward profiles* that are difficult to find elsewhere in the market.

* **The Democratization Aspect:**
    * Historically, access to highly skilled fund managers and sophisticated, curated investment strategies has been restricted to:
        * High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs).
        * Accredited Investors.
    * Stable Jack, through its Curated Pairs system, aims to **break down these barriers**, allowing the ***average DeFi user*** to access and benefit from such strategies in a safe and transparent manner.

# **The "Magic" Behind No Liquidations & No Funding Fees in Volatility Products**

* **Recap: The Twin Perils of Traditional Leveraged Trading:**
    * **Liquidation Risk:** The foremost danger where a price movement against a leveraged position can trigger a forced sale of collateral, often resulting in the *complete loss of the invested capital*.
    * **Funding Fees:** A persistent cost for maintaining leveraged positions in perpetual markets, eroding profitability, especially for long-term holds.

* **Stable Jack's Solution: A Bilateral Agreement on Asset Component Exposure**
    * The core mechanism involves two parties (or two sides of a pool) agreeing to split an asset's inherent characteristics – typically its yield and its price volatility.
    * **Example: Staked Ethereum (stETH)**
        * Assume stETH provides:
            * A staking yield (e.g., ~3.5% APY).
            * Price volatility (it can go up or down in value).
        * **The Agreement (Simplified):**
            * **User A (Volatility Taker):** "I want all the exposure to stETH's price changes (upside and downside). In return, I will give up my claim to stETH's staking yield."
            * **User B (Yield Taker):** "I want a more stable return. I will take your stETH's staking yield (in addition to my own), and in return, you can have my exposure to stETH's price changes."

* **Scenario Analysis (Both users notionally start with $100 worth of stETH):**

    * **Scenario 1: ETH Price Increases by 10%**
        * Each $100 worth of stETH is now worth $110.
        * **User A (Volatility Taker) Outcome:**
            * Their stETH is worth $110 (+$10).
            * They also receive the +$10 price gain from User B's stETH.
            * They give their $3.5 yield (approx.) to User B.
            * *Simplified Result (as per transcript's logic for clarity)*: User A's position effectively becomes $100 (initial) + $10 (own gain) + $10 (User B's gain) = $120. This represents a **20% gain for a 10% price move (2x leverage on price upside)**. No funding fee is paid.
        * **User B (Yield Taker) Outcome:**
            * Their stETH is worth $110, but they forgo their $10 price gain to User A.
            * They receive their own $3.5 yield + User A's $3.5 yield.
            * *Result*: User B's principal remains $100 (original value, shielded from direct price gain but also initial downside), and they earn **~7% yield (2x leverage on yield)**.

    * **Scenario 2: ETH Price Decreases by 10%**
        * Each $100 worth of stETH is now worth $90.
        * **User A (Volatility Taker) Outcome:**
            * Their stETH is worth $90 (-$10).
            * They effectively absorb User B's -$10 price loss as well (to make User B whole on principal against price drop).
            * They still notionally give their yield component.
            * *Simplified Result (as per transcript's logic)*: User A's position effectively becomes $100 (initial) - $10 (own loss) - $10 (covering User B's loss) = $80. This represents a **20% loss for a 10% price move (2x leverage on price downside)**. *Crucially, this is a decrease in their asset's value, not a forced liquidation by a third party.*
        * **User B (Yield Taker) Outcome:**
            * Their stETH is worth $90, but User A compensates them for the $10 price drop, bringing their principal value back to $100.
            * They still receive the doubled staking yield (~7%).
            * *Result*: User B's **principal is protected from the price downside**, and they earn the enhanced yield.

* **Key Takeaways on How Risks are Managed:**
    * There is **no external leverage provider** or lender involved, thus no margin calls in the traditional sense.
    * The "leverage" is an internal construct based on the agreed-upon split of outcomes.
    * **Risk of principal loss for the volatility taker exists if the market moves significantly against them**, but it's a reduction in their share of the pooled assets, not a sudden, forced liquidation that wipes out the entire position due to a margin call.
    * **Funding fees are absent** because the structure isn't a traditional perpetual derivative.

# **Achieving Fixed Yield in a Volatile Market with Stable Jack**

* **Ideal Investor Profile for Fixed Yield Offerings:**
    * Individuals and entities seeking predictable returns on **stablecoin holdings**.
    * **Hedge Funds** looking for reliable, low-risk yield generation.
    * **High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs)** desiring capital preservation with consistent earnings.

* **How Stable Jack Facilitates Fixed Yield – The "Guarantee" Mechanism:**
    * Imagine a scenario: A particular yield-bearing stablecoin (Collateral Asset) is currently offering a *variable* APY, say 15%. However, this rate can fluctuate.
    * **The Agreement:** Stable Jack enables a structure where users can opt for a **fixed yield** over a defined period (e.g., 10% APY for 3 months), regardless of the underlying asset's APY fluctuations.
    * **The Two Sides of the Fixed Yield Product:**
        * **Yield Token Holder (Fixed Yield Taker - User F):** This user locks in the agreed-upon fixed yield (e.g., 10%). They are guaranteed to receive this rate.
        * **Volatility/Variable Yield Token Holder (Variable Yield Taker - User V):** This user takes on the variability. They receive *all* the actual yield generated by the total pooled collateral (from both User F's and their own deposit). From this total yield, they are obligated to pay User F their guaranteed fixed portion.

* **Scenario Breakdown (Assuming User F and User V both deposit $100):**

    * **Scenario 1: Collateral Asset Yield = 15% (Higher than Fixed Rate)**
        * Total yield generated from the $200 pool = $30 (15% of $200).
        * User V (Variable Taker) is entitled to this $30.
        * User V pays User F (Fixed Taker) their guaranteed $10 (10% of User F's $100).
        * **Outcome for User F (Fixed):** $100 (principal) + $10 (fixed yield) = **$110**. *Achieved the 10% fixed rate.*
        * **Outcome for User V (Variable):** $100 (principal) + $30 (total yield received) - $10 (paid to User F) = **$120**. *Achieved a 20% variable yield.*

    * **Scenario 2: Collateral Asset Yield = 8% (Lower than Fixed Rate, but still positive)**
        * Total yield generated from the $200 pool = $16 (8% of $200).
        * User V receives this $16.
        * User V pays User F their guaranteed $10.
        * **Outcome for User F (Fixed):** $100 (principal) + $10 (fixed yield) = **$110**. *Still achieves the 10% fixed rate.*
        * **Outcome for User V (Variable):** $100 (principal) + $16 (total yield received) - $10 (paid to User F) = **$106**. *Achieved a 6% variable yield.*

    * **Scenario 3: Collateral Asset Yield = 2% (Significantly Lower than Fixed Rate)**
        * Total yield generated from the $200 pool = $4 (2% of $200).
        * User V receives this $4.
        * User V *is still obligated* to pay User F their $10.
        * **Outcome for User F (Fixed):** $100 (principal) + $10 (fixed yield) = **$110**. *Still achieves the 10% fixed rate.*
        * **Outcome for User V (Variable):** $100 (principal) + $4 (total yield received) - $10 (paid to User F) = **$94**. *Experiences a -6% return, as their principal is used to cover the shortfall in guaranteeing User F's fixed yield.*

* **Source of Compensation for Fixed Yield:**
    * Primarily, the fixed yield is paid from the **excess yield** captured by the Variable Yield Taker side of the pool.
    * In scenarios where the actual generated yield is insufficient to cover the guaranteed fixed rate, the compensation **can and will be drawn from the principal of the Variable Yield Taker** to ensure the Fixed Yield Taker receives their promised return.

# **Integrating with Yield-Generating Protocols & Collateral Types**

* **Current Approach to "Independent Strategies":**
    * As of the discussion, Stable Jack's model for "independent strategies" is less about third-party developers deploying entirely new, custom strategies *directly onto the Stable Jack platform as distinct vaults* (though the "Curated Pairs" system hints at such a future).
    * The immediate focus is on **integrating established, existing yield-bearing assets and protocols as collateral** within the Stable Jack framework.

* **Examples of Integrated Collaterals and Their Native Strategies:**
    * **Avantis (Yield-Bearing Stablecoin - AVUSD):**
        * Avantis itself is a protocol that generates yield for its stablecoin, often through sophisticated on-chain strategies involving derivatives or data analysis.
        * *Stable Jack's Role*: Accepts AVUSD (or similar assets from Avant) as **collateral**. Stable Jack then *structures products around this collateral* (e.g., fixed yield on AVUSD, leveraged AVUSD yield, or trading its associated points/volatility).
        * *Important Note*: Stable Jack does **not** manage Avant's internal yield-generation strategy; Avant is responsible for that. Stable Jack provides a new layer of utility for Avant's asset.
    * **Ethena Labs (sUSDe / USDe):**
        * Ethena generates yield via a "delta-neutral" strategy on its synthetic dollar.
        * *Stable Jack's Role*: Allows users to deposit sUSDe and choose between leveraged yield on sUSDe or leveraged exposure to Ethena's "shards" (points).
    * **Resolve (Presumably another yield protocol or stablecoin):**
        * Similar integration model expected.
    * **Other Stablecoins and Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs):**
        * The platform is designed to onboard various yield-generating base assets.

* **Stable Jack's Value Proposition in This Context:**
    * To take these pre-existing yield-bearing collateral types.
    * And then **structure them into novel products** for its users, offering choices such as:
        * Fixed Yield
        * Leveraged Yield
        * Leveraged Points Trading
        * Leveraged Volatility Trading (e.g., liquidation-free longs)

# **Positioning for Institutional Adoption & Key DeFi Narratives**

* **Prime Focus: Real World Assets (RWAs)**
    * RWAs are anticipated to become **one of the most significant product categories** and narratives in the DeFi ecosystem in the near future.
    * **Stable Jack's Proactive Steps & Existing Progress:**
        * Already secured agreements with several **Turkish banks**.
        * Engaged with banks in the **MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region** to explore offering their tokenized RWAs as collateral on the Stable Jack platform.
        * Actively in discussions with **FinTech companies in Latin America (LATAM)** for similar RWA integrations.
    * **Strategic Vision for RWAs:**
        * To position Stable Jack as a **primary venue or "home" for RWAs**, enabling them to effectively bridge into the DeFi ecosystem and access its liquidity and composability.
    * **Potential RWA-Based Use Cases on Stable Jack:**
        * Allowing users to take a **leveraged long position on their favorite tokenized stocks** (e.g., AAPL, TSLA) *without liquidation risk*.
        * Enabling users to earn **fixed yield or leveraged yield** on tokenized traditional finance assets like **bonds or other securities**.
    * Stable Jack is strategically aligning itself to be a key player in and beneficiary of the burgeoning **RWA tokenization trend.**

* **Alignment with Other Major DeFi Narratives:**
    * **Restaking (e.g., EigenLayer and similar models):** While not explicitly detailed, the structured product nature of Stable Jack (separating yield, points, volatility) is highly compatible with the components emerging from restaking ecosystems (e.g., restaked points, yield from Actively Validated Services - AVSs).
    * **Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs):** Already a core collateral type and product focus, and this will continue as LSDs are fundamental to PoS chain DeFi.

* **Overall Institutional Strategy:**
    * By focusing on safety, transparency, and innovative products around high-potential narratives like RWAs, Stable Jack aims to be an attractive platform for **institutional participants** looking to engage with DeFi.

# **Your First Steps with Stable Jack: Getting Started**

* **Tailoring Your Approach Based on Your Investment Goals:**

    * **1. If Your Priority is LEVERAGED EXPOSURE to Asset Price (e.g., you're bullish on price action):**
        * **Recommended Product:** Explore the **xAVAX product** on the Avalanche network.
        * ***Key Benefit***: Allows you to **long AVAX (or other supported assets in similar products) without the typical risk of liquidation** associated with leveraged trading on CEXs or DEXs, and without paying funding fees.

    * **2. If Your Priority is Maximizing POINTS (for airdrops, loyalty programs, etc.):**
        * **Recommended Products:** Look into Stable Jack's **Points Tokens**. Examples include (names may vary based on the specific underlying asset or campaign):
            * Points tokens for **sUSDe (Ethena 'shards')**
            * Points tokens for **SDAI (potentially related to MakerDAO's DSR or associated protocols like Avant on Sonic)**
            * **RAOs** (Specific to the Sonic ecosystem – likely a points-bearing asset or tokenized points for a protocol on Sonic)
            * **RSOX** (Specific to the Avalanche ecosystem – likely a points-bearing asset or tokenized points for a protocol on Avalanche)
        * ***Key Benefit***: Achieve **leveraged exposure to these points programs while benefiting from principal protection** on your underlying collateral.

    * **3. If Your Priority is SAFE, Enhanced, and Potentially LEVERAGED YIELD:**
        * **Recommended Products:** Utilize Stable Jack's **Yield Tokens.**
        * ***Key Benefit***: These tokens are designed to offer **above-market yields** compared to just holding the base asset, often with options for fixed or leveraged variable returns, all while maintaining a **very low-risk profile** for the principal invested (especially in fixed yield scenarios or when taking the yield side of a yield/volatility split).

* **A Note on Crypto Token Nomenclature:**
    * The founder acknowledges that the names of some tokens (e.g., RSOX, RAOs) can seem a bit difficult or esoteric for newcomers.
    * *"This is what crypto is about."* – A lighthearted acceptance of the often complex naming conventions within the space!
