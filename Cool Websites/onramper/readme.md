Onramper is an innovative fiat-to-crypto on-ramp solution that acts as a **gateway aggregator**, combining multiple fiat-to-crypto gateways into a single, streamlined platform. This allows businesses and entrepreneurs to enable their users to purchase cryptocurrencies directly on their websites or apps, simplifying the integration process and enhancing user access to crypto.
Key Features and Functionality

-   Purpose and Functionality: Onramper aggregates well-known fiat-to-crypto gateways---such as **MoonPay, Coinify, and Zenpo**---into one solution. This eliminates the need for businesses to manage multiple gateway integrations individually, making it easier to offer crypto purchasing options to users.

-   Integration Options:
    -   Widget: A customizable, production-ready tool that can be implemented on a website or app in minutes. It supports features like automatically inserting a user's public key and adjusting the widget's color to match the site or app's aesthetics.

    -   API: Offers more flexibility for businesses to create a tailored user experience (UX) and user interface (UI). While it requires more effort to integrate than the widget, it allows for deeper customization. The Onramper team is currently developing API wrappers to simplify this process.

-   Global Coverage: By integrating multiple gateways, Onramper provides extensive support for various countries, payment methods, cryptocurrencies, and fiat currencies, enabling businesses to reach a global audience.

-   Fee Structure:
    -   Users pay fees to the chosen fiat gateway plus a 1% transaction fee to Onramper.

    -   Onramper claims that its solution results in lower overall fees for users by selecting the gateway with the lowest fees for each transaction, often offsetting the 1% fee. In most cases, Onramper's fee is not added on top of the gateway's fee.

    -   Businesses can add their own fees to transactions using a special API key provided by Onramper, creating an additional revenue opportunity.

-   Upcoming Developments:
    -   An integration with the BTC Direct Transaction Ram Network is in the works, expanding the range of supported gateways.

    -   An off-ramp solution is being developed, which will allow users to sell crypto for fiat, adding further functionality to the platform.

Ease of Use and Customization

-   The widget is designed for quick implementation, removing the hassle of integrating multiple fiat gateways individually.

-   The API, while more complex, empowers businesses to build a fully customized crypto purchasing experience tailored to their needs.

-   Onramper provides a production-ready API key and supports widget customization, ensuring seamless integration with a business's branding and platform design. Additional technical details are available on GitHub for those interested in the implementation specifics.
