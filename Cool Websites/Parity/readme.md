Parity is a system that creates stablecoins, which are digital currencies with stable values. It operates on the Solana network and offers users a high return of 20% per year on their investments. This return is achieved through smart strategies that balance risks and rewards. Parity aims to be a top choice in the market for synthetic stablecoins, which are stablecoins backed by other assets rather than directly by reserves.


At the heart of Parity is the **Parity Dollar (PUSD)**, a stablecoin backed by delta-neutral strategies like **Hedged JLP** (Jupiter Liquidity Provider) and the **Solana Basis trade**. These strategies ensure the stability of PUSD's peg while generating consistent yield, making it an ideal asset for DeFi traders, liquidity providers, and crypto treasuries.

PUSD and sPUSD, the Parity Deposit Token, are designed to be the go-to assets for on-chain collateral and trade settlement, offering users a safe, high-yield alternative to traditional stablecoins.
