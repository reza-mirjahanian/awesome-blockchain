If you are a Restaking Operators, you are already running a set of operators for several restaking protocols (EigenLayer, Symbiotic...).

In order to have the vault creator select your operators, you need to:

1\. **Match the vault creator's requirements**

A vault creator will seek to allocate their assets onto several restaking protocols, several AVSs, and several operator sets.

Operators looking to onboarded onto this vault need to ensure that a subset of their machines is able to match the client's demand exactly. In other words, they need to have a machine (or multiple in combination) that can support the client's strategy.

If this is not the case, see [Creation of on-demand Restaking Operators](https://docs.byzantine.fi/node-operators/restaking/creation-of-on-demand-restaking-operators).

2\. Be selected by the vault creator

While ETH validators must be chosen from the set of Byzantine Node Operator Partners, this is not the case for restaking operators. Vault creators are free to select any restaking operator among all operators on the market.

That being said, the restaking operator selection process generally takes place via off-chain alignment between the client and the operator. In order to be suggested to clients by Byzantine during vault planning phases, operators should provide the ByzanTeam with the following information:

- For every operator :
    
    - The restaking protocol concerned
        
    - The underlying AVSs/networks
        
    - The associated operator sets
        
    - The address of the machine
        
    

Byzantine will then suggest the most appropriate fitting operators according to the vault creator's demand, among the partners'.
