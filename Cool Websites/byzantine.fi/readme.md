### **What is Byzantine?**

Byzantine is an open, **decentralised** platform allowing anyone to restake how they like and earn yield. Curators, institutions, and developers are able to create **custom restaking strategies**, deploy them as vaults, and integrate them into existing services or build new ones on Byzantine's flexible architecture.


### How does Byzantine work?

While each restaking protocol works differently, generally, Byzantine's technical advantage is standardising the interaction with all restaking protocols into the Byzantine vault. Users interact with and deploy and these vaults as they would with any smart contract.
When depositing into an active vault, users mint vaultshares corresponding to the value of their deposited assets and start earning rewards. To withdraw their stake and rewards, they burn their vaultshares partially or completely and thereby initiate the withdrawal processes of the networks they restaked into.


### Why Byzantine?

**Byzantine is the easiest access to your own restaking strategy.** Select any restaking protocols, networks, operators, and collateral assets and deploy your strategy instantly.
**Byzantine vaults integrate into DeFi easily.** Trade and leverage your vaultshares or build your own custom service, product, or even asset on Byzantine's flexible architecture.
‍
**Depositors can withdraw anytime.** Thanks to vaultshares owned by depositors, depositors keep complete control over their assets. Vault owners can change the startegy but can never withdraw their users' assets, adding an additional layer of security.
**Zero-governance, maximum security.** Every part of the Byzantine protocol is audited multiple times before launch. No one person has access or decision power to define what to do with users' assets. All deployed vaults can be upgraded only by the vault owner, meaning nobody but you is ever able to change how your vaults function.
‍**Full fund segregation.** Your vault's liquidity never co-mingles with other vaults and doesn't co-earn rewards. Your vault, your kingdom.


Does Byzantine control my assets?

Byzantine is non-custodial and holders always maintain full control over their assets.
