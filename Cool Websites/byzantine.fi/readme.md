**What is Byzantine?**

Byzantine is an open, **decentralised** platform allowing anyone to restake how they like and earn yield. Curators, institutions, and developers are able to create **custom restaking strategies**, deploy them as vaults, and integrate them into existing services or build new ones on Byzantine's flexible architecture.
