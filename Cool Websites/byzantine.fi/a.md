## **Re-staking Fundamentals**  

### **4. How does re-staking differ from traditional staking?**  
**Answer:**  
- **Staking**: APR is maintained as TVL grows (blockchains emit more rewards).  
- **Re-staking**: Fixed AVS budgets mean **rewards decrease as TVL increases**, pushing capital to explore newer/long-tail AVSs.  

### **5. Why do re-staking rewards diminish with higher TVL?**  
**Answer:**  
AVS budgets are **fixed**, so more participants dilute individual payouts. This creates incentives for capital to seek underutilized opportunities.  

### **6. What are the three main challenges in today’s re-staking ecosystem?**  
**Answer:**  
1. **Fragmentation**: Disjointed use cases.  
2. **Technical Complexity**: Costly cross-protocol integrations.  
3. **Inefficiency**: Monolithic platforms with one-size-fits-all risk management.

## **Product & Technology**  

### **7. What is a “re-staking aggregation layer”?**  
**Answer:**  
A unified infrastructure enabling:  
- **Permissionless Vaults**: Customizable across AVSs/chains.  
- **Cross-Chain Execution**: Swaps and bridging for multi-chain strategies.  
- **Risk Management Decoupling**: Separates infrastructure (Byzantine’s role) from risk strategies (users’ choice).  

### **8. How does Byzantine Finance address AVS fragmentation?**  
**Answer:**  
By allowing vaults to **simultaneously interact with multiple AVSs** (e.g., Babylon, Eigen Layer, Symbiotic) without requiring direct integrations.  

### **9. Can vaults restake across multiple chains?**  
**Answer:**  
Yes. Byzantine uses **cross-chain swaps** (e.g., bridging assets) to deploy capital on AVSs across Ethereum, Solana, and others.  

### **10. What is Distributed Validator Technology (DVT)?**  
**Answer:**  
A **decentralized validation mechanism** integrated into Byzantine’s MVP to enhance security and reduce reliance on centralized node operators.  

### **11. What is the difference between liquid and native re-staking?**  
**Answer:**  
- **Liquid Re-staking**: Users receive liquid tokens representing staked assets (tradeable while earning rewards).  
- **Native Re-staking**: Directly stake assets without liquidity tokens.  
Byzantine supports both models.
