The vault creator has 2 options :

1\. Work with a partner of their own

Vault creators can directly contact one of their trusted partners and request the creation of specific restaking operators. These operators' addresses will then be manually added at vault creation.

2\. Benefit from the Byzantine ecosystem

When receiving a demand from a vault creator, Byzantine speaks with operators in its ecosystem to match the request. This especially concerns larger, private deals.

Operators that have registered with Byzantine ( [Register as a Staking Operator](https://docs.byzantine.fi/node-operators/register-as-a-staking-operator)) will receive preferential access to these opportunities to help vault creators find their ideal strategy.
