Explanation of terms
====================

**Stakers / restakers**

Users looking to stake or restake their assets.

**Staking operator**

Refers to those who run Ethereum validators in staking or native restaking vaults.

**Restaking operator**

Refers to those who run AVS / network nodes in restaking vaults. They operate the different restaking networks and receive delegated stake from vaults.

**Curators**

Refers to those who select and adjust a vault's strategy and settings. This can be (but doesn't have to be) the vault owner.

**Native/integrated restaking**

Staking and restaking of ETH in a single vault. Can be known both as native or integrated restaking. This documentation applies the term "native restaking".

**Native vaults**

Byzantine Vaults exposed to both staking and restaking. The deposit token has to be the native token of the chain used (ETH on Ethereum).

**ERC20 restaking**

In contrast to native restaking, ERC20 restaking means restaking any ERC20 asset, such as LSTs or even USDC. The AVS / networks individually decide which ERC20s they accept as stake.

**ERC20 vaults**

Byzantine Vaults only exposed to restaking. The collateral asset / deposit token can be any ERC20 token.

**AVSs / networks**

The different proof-of-stake networks looking for economic security from restaking protocols.

**Strategy**

A combination of AVSs and protocols that a particular strategy vault is restaking into.
