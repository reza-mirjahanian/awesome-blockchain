What is Byzantine Finance?
==========================

Byzantine is a trustless and efficient restaking layer with permissionless strategy creation. We enable the deployment of minimal, individual, and isolated restaking strategy vaults by specifying:

-   A restaking strategy, composed of:

    -   A set of AVSs / networks

    -   One or multiple restaking protocols

-   A collateral asset

-   Portfolio flexibility (immutable or modifiable strategy)

-   Investor permissions (open or whitelisted stakers)

-   An (optional) liquidity token

The Byzantine protocol is trustless and designed to be more efficient, modular, and flexible than any other decentralized restaking platform.

All vaults are entirely independent of each other: Funds are fully segregated between them and risk is completely isolated. Vaults are not affected by governance.


Separating risk management & infrastructure
--------------------------------------------

Byzantine achieves this flexibility by separating the [risk management ("strategy layer")](https://docs.byzantine.fi/the-basics/strategy-layer-and-infrastructure-layer-explain-like-im-5#the-strategy-layer) from the [infrastructure ("infrastructure layer")](https://docs.byzantine.fi/the-basics/strategy-layer-and-infrastructure-layer-explain-like-im-5#meet-the-infra-layer):

Strategy vaults are only one example of permissionless risk management built on Byzantine. Any protocol, DAO, or individual can build on the Byzantine infrastructure layer to either help users manage risk or integrate restaking yields into existing service offerings.

Crucially, risk management is performed externally from Byzantine. Therefore, Byzantine is not tied to any particular investment outcomes.
