What is Byzantine Finance?
==========================

Byzantine is a trustless and efficient restaking layer with permissionless strategy creation. We enable the deployment of minimal, individual, and isolated restaking strategy vaults by specifying:

-   A restaking strategy, composed of:

    -   A set of AVSs / networks

    -   One or multiple restaking protocols

-   A collateral asset

-   Portfolio flexibility (immutable or modifiable strategy)

-   Investor permissions (open or whitelisted stakers)

-   An (optional) liquidity token

The Byzantine protocol is trustless and designed to be more efficient, modular, and flexible than any other decentralized restaking platform.

All vaults are entirely independent of each other: Funds are fully segregated between them and risk is completely isolated. Vaults are not affected by governance.
