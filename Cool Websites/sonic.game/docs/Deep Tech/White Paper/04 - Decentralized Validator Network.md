## 🔐 Decentralized Validator Network – **HyperGrid**

---

### 🏦 **Staking & Security**

* **Validators stake SOL** – *Collateral required to participate (100 SOL to initiate).*
* **Active commitment** – *Staking secures all Grids, similar to EigenLayer’s re-staking model.*
* **Collective staking pool** – *Serves as a security foundation for the entire network.*

---

### ⚙️ **Validator Roles & Responsibilities**

* **📜 Transaction Sequencing** – *Order and process incoming transactions from Grids.*
* **📦 Slot Proposal** – *Propose blocks (slots) to each Grid; computation handled by Grids.*
* **✅ Execution Verification** – *Check execution results against expected state transitions.*
* **📤 State Commitment** – *Post verified state transitions to Solana Mainnet.*
* **Shared Sequencer Function** – *Future L2s prioritize Validators as sequencers.*

---

### 💰 **Incentive Model**

* **Rewards in HyperGrid tokens** – *Aligns validator interests with network health.*
* **\$veSonic staking by users** – *Users lock Sonic Tokens → \$veSonic, stake with Validators, and share rewards.*
* **Revenue streams for Validators** – *Includes Sequence Fees and validator-user reward splits.*
* **Observation Nodes** – *Monitor L2 transactions, detect malicious activity, trigger slashing, rewarded in \$Sonic.*

---

### 🎯 **Value Proposition of \$veSonic**

* **Ecosystem revenue capture** – *Swap fees, NFT marketplace fees, launchpad revenue shares.*
* **Exclusive rewards** – *Future HyperGrid games reward \$veSonic holders, allowing choice of game rewards.*

---

### 🔄 **Dynamic Equilibrium**

* **Adaptive staking & rewards** – *Adjusts to transaction volume, security risks, and computational demand.*
* **Scalability mechanism** – *Increase rewards to attract more validators during high load.*
* **Security reinforcement** – *Raise staking requirements during heightened threat levels.*
