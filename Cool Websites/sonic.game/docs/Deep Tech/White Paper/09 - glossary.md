1. **HyperGrid**  
   *A Rollups horizontal scaling solution proposed in the Solana ecosystem.*  

2. **Sonic Shared Sequencer Network (SSSN)**  
   *A multi-node distributed system within the HyperGrid architecture for access management, intelligent allocation, program invocation, and serialized transaction execution.*  

3. **Sonic SVM**  
   *An execution environment for smart contracts and dApps within the Sonic ZK-Coprocessor of each Grid.*  

4. **Grid**  
   *The division of the HyperGrid system into multiple, smaller units for better management and scalability. Each Grid has its own independent Sonic ZK-Coprocessor component.*  

5. **State Compression Technology**  
   *A technology used in HyperGrid to reduce the size of the state for more efficient processing.*  

6. **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)**  
   *A property of systems that allows them to resist Byzantine faults â€” meaning the system can continue to function correctly even if some nodes fail or act maliciously.*

7. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**  
   *A cryptographic method allowing one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any other information. Maintains privacy and security â€” the verifier learns only that the statement is true, without knowing the specific details.*  

8. **ZK-Coprocessor**  
   *A core component of the Grid, ensuring that each Grid has its independent transaction execution environment, program, and data management.*  

9. **DHTAccountsDB DA**  
   *A data availability layer natively built within HyperGrid, built on Kademlia Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs).*  

10. **FOCG (Fully on-Chain Game)**  
    *Games where all data and states are stored and accessed via the blockchain.*  

11. **Throughput**  
    *The number of transactions a blockchain network can process per second.*  

12. **Latency**  
    *The time it takes for a transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain.*  

13. **Scalability**  
    *The ability of a blockchain network to handle a growing amount of transactions or processing.*  

14. **State Management**  
    *The management of all blockchain state data â€” including account balances, smart contracts, and relevant metadata.*  

15. **NFT (Non-Fungible Token)**  
    *Digital assets that represent real-world objects like art, music, in-game items, and videos, which can be bought, sold, and traded online.*
