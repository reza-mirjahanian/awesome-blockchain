## 🧠 **Core Concepts of Grids and Network Relationships**

### 🕸️ **Grid Architecture**
- **HyperGrid Design**  
  *Supports a large number of decentralized applications (dAPPs) with minimal performance impact on Solana L1.*
- **FOCGs (Fully On-Chain Games)**  
  *Sonic’s implementation focuses on enabling large-scale FOCGs through HyperGrid.*

### ⚙️ **Performance Isolation**
- **Minimized Interference**  
  *Each dAPP operates independently, reducing cross-application performance degradation.*
- **Independent Transaction Processing**  
  *Verification, recording, and reading of transactions are handled separately for each grid.*

### 🧱 **Scalability Options**
- **Public vs. Exclusive Grids**  
  *Developers can choose between using the shared public grid or creating their own dedicated grid.*
- **Horizontal Scaling**  
  *Exclusive grids allow horizontal expansion tailored to specific application needs.*

### 💡 **Developer Flexibility**
- **Custom Grid Deployment**  
  *Grids can be created or shut down without affecting others.*
- **Performance vs. Cost Trade-off**  
  *Grid choice depends on the developer’s evaluation of performance requirements and cost efficiency.*

## 🔗 **Bridging Mechanism & Program Deployment**

### 🌉 **Asset Bridging**
- **HyperGrid Bridging Protocol**  
  *Facilitates secure and efficient asset movement between Solana L1 and individual grids.*
- **No Direct Grid-to-Grid Bridge**  
  *All cross-grid interactions are routed through Solana L1 via the HyperGrid network.*

### 🧠 **Cross-Grid Data Access**
- **Unified HyperGrid Network**  
  *Enables seamless access to data across different grids through Solana L1.*

### 🛠️ **Developer Control**
- **Grid Form Selection**  
  *Developers choose grid types based on application-specific requirements.*

### 🚀 **High-Performance dAPP Deployment**
- **TPS Thresholds for Scaling**  
  *Recommended to deploy a new independent grid if dAPP exceeds:*  
  - *100,000 average TPS*  
  - *1,000,000 peak TPS*
- **Horizontal Scaling Strategy**  
  *Creating a dedicated grid ensures performance isolation and operational stability for high-throughput dAPPs.*
