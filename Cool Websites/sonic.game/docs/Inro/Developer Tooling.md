Developer Tooling
=================

In this section you will find some helpful information to help you during development. We have created some resources to make the development experience as smooth as butter:

1.  [**Sonic Explorer**](https://docs.sonic.game/developers/developer-tooling/explorer) - A web-based tool that provides detailed insights into the Solana blockchain, allowing users to view transactions, accounts, blocks, and network statistics in real-time.

2.  [**Sonic Faucet**](https://docs.sonic.game/developers/developer-tooling/faucet) - A web-based tool that airdrops development SOL for facilitating transaction fees on Sonic Devnet environment.

3.  [**Wallet Extensions**](https://docs.sonic.game/developers/developer-tooling/wallet-extensions) - If you're building on Sonic for the browser, we have curated a list of recommended browser wallets for Sonic. Support for more wallets is continuously on-going.

4.  [**Kronus**](https://kronus.sonic.game/) - We recommend you deploy program updates with a multisig program authority.
