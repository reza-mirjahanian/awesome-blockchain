## 🌀 Sonic Governance Framework — Key Points & Learning Notes

---

### 🗳 **Understanding Sonic Governance**

* **Decentralized, community-driven decision-making** *involving SONIC holders, builders, validators, and users.*
* **Governance process phases**: 🌡 *Temperature checks* → 📜 *Proposal submissions* → ✅ *Voting* → 🔗 *On-chain execution*.

---

### 🔐 **Voting on Proposals**

* **veSONIC** = *vote-escrowed SONIC*, obtained by converting SONIC **1:1** to gain voting power.
* **HyperFuse Guardian Node operators**:

  * Earn **veSONIC rewards** for maintaining the **HyperGrid Network**.
  * Rewards usable directly for proposal voting.

---

### 📉 **Voting Power Decay**

* **Anti-manipulation mechanism**:

  * Voting power **starts to decay** halfway through the voting period.
  * **Linear decay over time** reduces influence of large, concentrated holdings.
* **Example**:

  * 7-day vote:

    * First 3.5 days → full power (e.g., 100 veSONIC).
    * Day 5 → \~66 veSONIC.
    * Day 7 → near 0 veSONIC.

---

### 🛡 **HyperFuse Guardian Nodes**

* Detect and alert on **transaction/state discrepancies**.
* Safeguard rollup operations with **accuracy and integrity**.

---

### 📅 **Governance Phases**

#### 1️⃣ **Initial Feedback & Discussion**

* Platform: 🗨 *Sonic Research Forum*.
* **Min. 7 working days** for community feedback.
* Purpose: *Refine ideas, gauge interest, gather feedback.*
* Only proposals with enough support move to Phase 2.

#### 2️⃣ **Proposal Submission & Final Voting**

* Requires **locking 120,000 veSONIC** to create an official proposal.
* **Voting**:

  * 1 veSONIC = 1 vote.
  * Voting power decay applies from halfway point.
  * Period: **14 days**.
* **Quorum**: Only “YES” votes count; needs **30M veSONIC YES votes** to pass.
* **Voting delay**: 2 days before snapshot finalization.
* Any member can trigger execution after voting ends.

#### 3️⃣ **Ongoing Feedback & Future Planning**

* Continuous evaluation & adaptation post-implementation.
* Long-term goal: Transition to a **fully decentralized DAO**.

---

### ⚙ **Governance Powers**

* Set **minimum quorum**, **voting period**, **voting delay**, and **proposal threshold**.

---

### 👥 **Committees**

* **Maintenance Committee**:

  * Ensures proposals follow governance rules.
  * Blocks non-compliant proposals.
  * Handles upgrades, royalties, and contract changes.
* **Incentive Committee**:

  * Manages rewards for users and developers.
  * Can allocate **up to n%** of total supply for incentives.
