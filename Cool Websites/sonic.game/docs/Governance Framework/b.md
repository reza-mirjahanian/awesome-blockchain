## üó≥Ô∏è Sonic Governance Framework

Sonic's governance system is a **decentralized, community-driven** approach. It allows **SONIC holders, builders, validators, and users** to shape the ecosystem through a structured process involving discussion, proposals, and voting.

### üí° Understanding Key Concepts

* **Voting Power (veSONIC)**:
    * **veSONIC** stands for *vote-escrowed SONIC*.
    * Users convert **SONIC** to **veSONIC** on a 1:1 basis to gain voting power.
    * **HyperFuse Guardian Node** operators also earn **veSONIC** rewards for maintaining the network. These nodes *act as a safeguard, detecting discrepancies in transactions to ensure network integrity*.

* **Voting Power Decay** üìâ:
    * *Purpose*: To **prevent manipulation** by large token holders and promote fairer outcomes.
    * *On Individual Proposals*: A user's voting power begins to decay **halfway through the voting period**.
    * *Overall*: A user's total voting power also **decays linearly over time**, gradually reducing the influence of large, concentrated holdings.

### üîÑ Governance Phases

The governance process is structured into three distinct phases.

#### **Phase 1: Initial Feedback & Discussion** üó£Ô∏è
* **Platform**: **Sonic Research Forum** is used for community discussions.
* **Timeframe**: A minimum of **7 working days** is required for feedback.
* **Key Features**: This phase is for *refining ideas, gauging community interest, and gathering input*. Only proposals with sufficient support proceed.

#### **Phase 2: Proposal Submission & Final Voting** ‚úÖ
* **Proposal Creation**: Proposers must lock **[120,000] veSONIC** to submit a formal proposal for a vote.
* **Voting Mechanism**: One **veSONIC** token equals one vote. The **Voting Power Decay** mechanism is active during this phase.
* **Voting Period**: **14 days**.
* **Voting Quorum**: A proposal needs at least **[30] million "YES" votes** to pass. *Only "YES" votes are counted towards the quorum*.
* **Voting Delay**: There is a **2-day delay** after voting ends before the results are finalized.

#### **Phase 3: Ongoing Feedback & Future Planning** üìà
* *Purpose*: Provides a mechanism for **ongoing feedback** on implemented proposals and allows for regular community evaluations to adapt to new challenges.
* **Long-Term Goal**: To transition into a fully decentralized autonomous organization (**DAO**).

### üèõÔ∏è Governance Powers & Committees

The community and specialized committees have specific powers to manage the ecosystem.

#### **Community Governance Powers**
The community has the power to vote on changes to key governance parameters, including:
* Set **Minimum Quorum**
* Set **Voting Period**
* Set **Voting Delay**
* Set **Proposal Threshold**

#### **Specialized Committees** üë•
* **Maintenance Committee**:
    * *Ensures proposals meet community standards* and follow proper procedures.
    * Blocks proposals that violate governance rules.
    * Facilitates upgrades and handles dynamic issues like royalties.
* **Incentive Committee**:
    * *Manages incentives* for ecosystem participants (users and developers).
    * Can allocate a portion of the total token supply for rewards.
