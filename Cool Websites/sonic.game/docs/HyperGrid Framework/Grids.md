## 🗂 **Grids — Key Concepts**

### 🧩 **Definition**

* **Grids** → *Semi-autonomous, application-specific networks* operating within the **HyperGrid framework**.
* Designed to support **specialized workloads** while integrating with the **Solana Base Layer** for consensus & security.

---

### ⚙ **Core Characteristics**

* **Application Focused** 🎯 → Each grid can be tailored for *gaming, DeFi, AI agents*, or other high-demand use cases.
* **Semi-Autonomous Operation** 🔄 → Independent execution, validation, and data handling.
* **Customizable Architecture** 🏗 → Configurable runtimes, consensus mechanisms, and resource allocation.

---

### 📡 **Operational Scope**

1. **Validation** ✅ → Processes its own transaction & state change verification.
2. **Execution** 🖥 → Runs applications using **SVM runtime** or other compatible environments.
3. **State Management** 🌳 → Uses Merkle trees and ZK proofs for integrity and scalability.
4. **Interaction** 👤 → Users connect directly to a specific grid for transactions.

### 🔗 **Relationship with HyperGrid & Solana**

* **Anchored to Solana** 🪝 → Gains finality and security from the Solana Base Layer.
* **Interoperability** 🔄 → Can share state with other grids via the **HyperGrid Shared State Network (HSSN)**.
* **Scalable Deployment** 📈 → Supports horizontal scaling through multiple specialized grid instances.
