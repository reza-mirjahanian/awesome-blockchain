## Overview
**Sonic** is a chain extension on **Solana**, positioning itself as the **first TikTok App Layer** and a scalable solution for games, applications, and Web3 experiences. Built using the **Sonic HyperGrid Framework**, Sonic aims to onboard the next billion users to Web3 by enhancing Solana’s gaming ecosystem with high throughput and low-cost transactions.

Key Product: **Sonic SVM** (Sonic Virtual Machine) – a high-performance execution layer designed specifically for gaming and interactive applications.

---

## Vision
Sonic’s vision is to **expand the Solana Gaming Ecosystem** to support **millions of requests per second per game**, while maintaining **settlement finality on Solana L1**. This enables high-frequency gameplay and real-time interactions without sacrificing decentralization or security.

---

## HyperGrid: Solana’s State-of-the-Art Layer 2
**HyperGrid** is a **parallel processing framework** that serves as a Layer 2 scaling solution for Solana, tailored for gaming and high-throughput applications.

### Key Features:
- **Customizability & Scale**: Enables developers to build high-performance dApps with tailored execution environments.
- **Native Composability with Solana**: Fully interoperable with Solana L1—no need to redeploy programs or accounts.
- **Atomic Interoperability**: Execute cross-layer transactions atomically, leveraging Solana’s liquidity and services directly.

---

## Sonic Testnet & Sonic Odyssey
The **Sonic Testnet is live**, and users are invited to participate in **Sonic Odyssey**—an incentive campaign designed to drive engagement and direct interaction with the testnet.

## RUSH – Onchain Game Development Framework
**RUSH** is a **Rust-based ECS framework** that simplifies blockchain integration, enabling any game to become a **Fully On-Chain Game** or **Autonomous World**.

### Core Features:
- **In-Game Asset Trading**: Players can trade, buy, and sell in-game assets, fostering a **dynamic on-chain economy**.
- **Secure User Authentication**: Ensures safe and verifiable player identity and ownership.
- **Customizable On-Chain Logic**: Developers can extend on-chain operations with custom business rules.
- **One-Click Deployment**: Instantly deploy on-chain assets and game blueprints without managing backend complexity.
- **Ecosystem-Friendly Integration**: Compatible with popular game engines and development tools.

---

## ECS Framework & Gaming Primitives
- Based on **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** architecture, ideal for modular and scalable game development.
- Exposes **native composable gaming primitives** on-chain.
- Enables developers to define game entities (players, items, etc.) and behaviors in a structured, reusable way.

---

## Monetization Infrastructure
Sonic natively integrates tools for:
- **User acquisition and growth**
- **Traffic routing and analytics**
- **In-game payments and settlements**
- Supports sustainable game economies with built-in Web3 monetization.
