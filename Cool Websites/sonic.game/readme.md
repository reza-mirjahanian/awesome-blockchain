## Overview
**Sonic SVM** is the **first chain extension on Solana**, optimized for:
- Games
- Applications
- TikTok-style app layers

It uses the **Sonic HyperGrid Framework** to scale and onboard the next billion Web3 users.

---

## Vision
Sonic aims to:
- Expand the **Solana Gaming Ecosystem**
- Handle **millions of requests per second** per game
- Settle data back to **Solana L1** for finality

The focus is on enabling **new, immersive experiences** for both developers and players.

---

## HyperGrid Framework
**HyperGrid** is a **state-of-the-art parallel processing Layer 2 solution** for Solana with:
- **Customizability** for game & app needs
- **Native composability** with Solana programs
- Ability to **scale throughput drastically**
- **Interpreter support** for cross-chain deployment (EVM → SVM)

If you’d like, I can also make a **visual one-page “product sheet”** for this using tables & flow diagrams so it reads like a professional blockchain protocol overview.  
Do you want me to prepare that?
