- **For Money Game**:  
  - *On-chain tile game* (like Candy Crush) where players stake $SONIC for in-game keys.  
  - **NFT Collection**: Sold out instantly, proving demand for Solana NFTs.  
- **Astro Kids Comic**: Partnership with *World* (Solana game) to launch NFTs granting access to comics ($5 retail price).
