Smart contracts in Nibiru's primary execution engine (Wasm) are impervious to the vast majority of common attack vectors, such as reentrancy, arithmetic overflow/underflow, ERC20 short address attacks, and many others that plague the Web3 landscape. This means high-reliability apps can be brought to life more rapidly and scale to serve the growing cryptocurrency user base.
