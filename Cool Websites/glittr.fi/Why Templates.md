**Why Templates?**

Glittr uses templates for Glyphs to ensure the financial viability of decentralized validation and enforcement. Templates allow for:

-   **Efficient validation**: Transactions can be validated in constant time, making the process more efficient.
-   **Limited programmability**: By not allowing arbitrary programmability, Glittr avoids the need for gas payments or off-chain computation.
-   **Sufficient functionality**: Most DeFi functionality can be built using Glittr's templates, making Turing Completeness unnecessary.
-   **Future extensibility**: New templates can be added in the future to support additional functionality, as long as they are deemed efficient by the validator network.
