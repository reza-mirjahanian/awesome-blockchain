#### What is Enso?

##### Introduction[#](https://www.enso.finance/deep-dive/what#introduction)

Enso is a network that abstracts all Smart Contract interactions on **Rollups, AppChains, and blockchains.** Making it easy for developers to embed the whole ecosystem in their applications through intents without having to worry about the underlying complexities, empowering chain abstraction and modularity without the overhead of manually integrating every Smart Contract and framework.

Applications use Enso as the central hub for accessing transactable data to offer their users the decentralized ecosystem at their user's fingertips with the most optimal execution. With the nature of Enso being the full library of Smart Contract abstractions, new primitives for user experience are being built using Enso that propel blockchain usage as a whole.

By **turning user requests into intents,** and Enso mapping every Smart Contract interaction with their relationship to other Smart Contracts; **Enso inherently connects all of crypto in one unified place to be consumed easily.**

##### Why Enso?[#](https://www.enso.finance/deep-dive/what#why-enso)

Fragmentation continues to grow with more RollApps, Rollups, and L1s being deployed, making it extremely challenging for developers to keep up to date with the latest evolutions, and embed products built on top of these frameworks. Developers as of today are forced to choose what frameworks they support, and what products they should integrate due to limited developer resources, and no common interface to request translatable data.

At Enso we believe developers should be able to interact with any protocol on any chain at any time, and the Enso network acts as a shared map of all Smart Contracts abstractions enabling this future.

##### Network Participants?[#](https://www.enso.finance/deep-dive/what#network-participants)

The success of the Enso network lies with **3 key participants; Action Providers, Graphers, and Validators,** each of which plays a crucial role in the decentralization, and accessibility of protocol execution.

**Action providers**: These are developers who deploy an action abstraction onto the Enso network, stating how to interact with a particular protocol on the chains supported, and hosting relevant data required for executing on the protocol. Each action submitted conforms to a standard module that can incorporate many types of protocols underneath for easy consumption and usage. Once these actions have been simulated, and checked by the independent validator set, these actions will then live on the Enso network, and be part of the shared network state.

**Graphers**: To fulfil many different intents(**user requests**), independent mathematicians who are focused on algorithms traverse the shared network state created by the action providers, and other sources to find the most optimal route for achieving that user request. Separating the role of contributions actions from traversing actions, brings a further efficient framework as these mathematicians do not care what data they are consuming, they only want clean data provided by the action providers.

**Validators**: As Enso is a fully permissionless system enabling any developer to contribute actions to the network, independent parties known as validators are a layer of security, and validation of proposals on the network. Specifically, they are ensuring no malicious actions are being added, handling acceptance of requests to the network, and simulating solutions provided to ensure the most optimal solution is selected.
