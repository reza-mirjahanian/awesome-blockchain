## Diving into Defi Aggregation with Eno Finance

In today's decentralized finance or DeFi ecosystem, user experience (UX) can be a complicated affair. With the plethora of individual steps and complex transactions, it's easy for the average user to feel overwhelmed and opt out of the entire process. However, Eno Finance is working tirelessly to solve this issue by streamlining DeFi transactions using 'Intents'. In today's article, we're going to chat about DeFi aggregation with Eno Finance Co-founder, Connor.

## The Journey into Crypto with Connor from Eno 

Connor, who has been in the crypto space since 2011, is the founder of Eno Finance. His adventures in cryptography began by running large Bitcoin farms for World of Warcraft and RuneScape. However, it wasn't until 2016 that he began full-time Ethereum development. Prior to founding Eno, he developed code storage, hot storage, a fully collateralized stable coin, a secondary exchange multi, and so forth for a regulated, licensed digital asset bank in Switzerland.

## Deciphering 'Intents' and Enhancing User Experience 

When asked about 'intents', Connor described them as shortcuts of blockchain that enable users to go from point A to point B without worrying about what is required to reach their destination. For instance, if you're flying from Zurich to Berlin, you do not concern yourself with the minute details such as hiring employees, refilling the gas, and other regulations. Instead, you focus on reaching Berlin. Similarly, 'intents' make the transition hassle-free for users by abstracting away the individual steps required to execute a transaction.

## The Revolutionary Impact of Defi Intents 

As of today, 'intents' facilitate only token swaps, i.e., from token A to token B. However, Eno Finance anticipates that with time, intents will redefine how users interact with the blockchain. They expect that in future, intents will go beyond swaps to entail other DeFi actions such as lending, borrowing, creating vaults, and claiming rewards.

## Addressing Security Concerns

While intents may provide an appealing solution to DeFi complexities, they also open up avenues for potential risks and vulnerabilities. Connor acknowledged this concern, indicating that there have been instances where users were hacked due to weak intent mechanisms. As a result, Eno Finance is dedicated to bolstering its systems' security both on the web3 and web2 fronts. This entails robust management of private keys and inventory as well as proactive monitoring against potential Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

## Upcoming Features on Enoâ€™s Roadmap

Looking forward, Eno is currently developing an 'executable network' for all DeFi actions across all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains. This network aims to act as a full abstraction layer that connects all of crypto within one place. Users can expect to see more information on this in the coming months.

Answering a question about going non-Ethereum, Connor informed that while they plan to do so eventually, they want to establish a strong base layer across all EVM chains first before expanding to different non-EVM chains.

## Connecting with Eno Finance 

For users and developers eager to engage with Eno Finance, they can visit Eno's official website or check out the developer documentation on their site. They also have a developer-focused telegram group where the Eno team helps guide developers through their journey.

This concludes our dive into DeFi aggregation with Eno Finance. Despite the intricate and daunting nature of DeFi, initiatives like these are playing a crucial role in eliminating barriers and fostering broader and easier participation. With further development and innovation in this space, the future of DeFi looks promising.
