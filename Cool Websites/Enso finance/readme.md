# Building the intent engine

Enso network abstracts all smart contract interactions  
on rollups, appchains, and blockchains for execution.


#### Action Providers

Developers deploy a Smart Contract action onto the Enso network, collectively creating a shared map of all Smart Contract. Each action conforms to a standard module for easy consumption.


#### Graphers

Write custom algorithms for finding the most optimal strategy for combining actions, and off-chain sources to fulfil the request.

#### Validators

Provide security guarantee on the solutions provided by simulating, and indepth calldata traces on all solutions generated.




## Introduction

**Connor's Introduction:**
- Connor, a co-founder of Enso.
- Has been building in the Ethereum field for the last eight years.
- Prior experience in Bitcoin since 2013.


## Agenda
- **Purpose:** Provide context on the evolution of Eno.
- **Focus:** Intents and the Enso Network.

## Evolution of Eno
- **Two Choices for Crypto Projects:**
  - Artificially create product-market fit by launching a token.
  - Navigate the unknown without a token.

- **Eno's Approach:**
  - Started with a vampire attack, attacking six protocols and incentivizing with NFTs.
  - Launched social trading for creating social strategies in DeFi and ERC20 tokens.

- **Challenges Faced:**
  - Integrating all of DeFi conveniently without incurring high audit costs.

- **Solution Development:**
  - Rebuilt everything from scratch.
  - Created a holistic UI for interacting with all of DeFi.
  - Enabled integrating a new DeFi protocol within 30 minutes safely.

## Intents and the Inso Network
- **Concept of Intents:**
  - Users express their intention to go from token A to a DeFi position.
  - Logic of how to achieve the intent is abstracted away for the developer.
  - Intents can include token states, NFTs, DeFi positions, or any on-chain interaction.

- **Enso Network's Role:**
  - Acts as a job bulletin board for intents.
  - Solvers or resolvers fulfill these intents.

- **Example:**
  - A user wanting to interact with Beefy requires multiple token interactions.
  - Enso abstracts this complexity, allowing the user to achieve their intent without detailed steps.

## Enso's API and Network Participants
- **API Integration:**
  - Allows developers to embed DeFi actions into their products easily.
  - Examples: Lending, borrowing, swapping, LPs.

- **Growth and Usage:**
  - From $8 million in the first year to over $12 billion with 35+ projects using it in production.

- **Key Participants:**
  - **Action Providers:** Define interactions with smart contracts.
  - **Graphers:** Traverse actions and propose solutions.
  - **Validators:** Simulate and validate proposed solutions.

## Intent Network Example
- **How It Works:**
  - Developers specify their intent (e.g., interact with an NFT, DeFi position).
  - Enso abstracts all the required interactions to achieve the intent.

- **Comparison to Job Boards:**
  - Similar to job postings on LinkedIn or Upwork.
  - Solvers fulfill the intents by performing the required actions.

## Developer and Ecosystem Benefits
- **Developer Experience:**
  - Simplifies integrating multiple DeFi protocols.
  - Developers specify the desired outcome, not the steps to achieve it.

- **Enso Vision:**
  - All developer interactions will be intent-based.
  - Provides a convenient way to embed blockchain interactions into applications.



## Audience Q&A
- **Adding New Smart Contracts:**
  - Standardization of different primitives.
  - Developers can plug in how to interact with other smart contracts.

- **Centralization and Decentralization:**
  - Initially centralized; will transition to validators and graphers running their own algorithms.

- **Abstracting Intents:**
  - Intents can be explicit, semi-explicit, or fully abstracted.
  - Tools on top of Inso can help specify and execute these intents.

## Business Model
- **Current Approach:**
  - Takes a spread comparison to other solutions.
  - Future fees based on volume and usage.

- **Competitive Edge:**
  - Specializes in DeFi routing, quickly integrating new protocols.
