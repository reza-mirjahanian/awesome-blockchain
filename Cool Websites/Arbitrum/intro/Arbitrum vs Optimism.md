Arbitrum and Optimism

| Feature                 | Arbitrum                                                                                                                               | Optimism                                                                                                                                  |

| **Core Technology** | Optimistic Rollup                                                                                                                      | Optimistic Rollup                                                                                                                         |
| **Fraud Proofs** | **Multi-round interactive proving.** Disputes are narrowed down to a single step of execution, which is then verified on L1. This can be more gas-efficient for on-chain dispute resolution in complex cases. Aims for permissionless validation. The BOLD (Bounded Liquidity Delay) protocol is designed for faster, bounded-time dispute resolution. | **Single-round fault proofs.** The entire disputed transaction is re-executed on L1. This can be simpler but potentially more expensive on L1 for complex disputes. Has been working on next-generation fault proofs (e.g., "Cannon," now "Spark"). |
| **EVM Compatibility** | **EVM+ (Arbitrum Virtual Machine - AVM):** Highly compatible with EVM bytecode. Aims for near-equivalence. Supports Solidity, Vyper, and other EVM languages. **Stylus** upgrade allows for smart contracts in languages like Rust, C, and C++ that compile to WASM, running alongside EVM contracts. | **EVM Equivalence (historically OVM, now closer to direct EVM execution):** Designed for strong EVM equivalence, aiming to make migration from Ethereum as seamless as possible for developers. Tools and code often work with minimal to no changes. |
| **Transaction Sequencing** | Typically uses a **centralized Sequencer** that orders transactions on a first-come, first-served basis. This Sequencer posts batches of transactions to L1. Has mechanisms for users to submit transactions directly to L1 if the Sequencer is down or censoring (L1 escape hatch). | Also typically uses a **centralized Sequencer** to order transactions and submit them to L1. Provides mechanisms for users to force transaction inclusion via L1 if the Sequencer is unavailable (L1 escape hatch, with a defined sequencing window). |
| **Data Availability** | **Arbitrum One (Rollup mode):** Posts all transaction data to Ethereum L1 (calldata or blobs), inheriting Ethereum's security for data availability. \<br\> **Arbitrum Nova (AnyTrust mode):** Uses a Data Availability Committee (DAC) to store data off-chain, with an on-chain attestation. This significantly reduces costs but introduces an additional trust assumption on the DAC. | Primarily posts transaction data to Ethereum L1 (calldata or blobs). The OP Stack allows for configurable data availability layers, potentially including off-chain solutions in the future for specific "OP Chains." |
| **Governance** | Governed by the **Arbitrum DAO** and the **$ARB token**. Token holders can vote on proposals related to protocol upgrades, fund allocation, and Security Council elections. The Security Council can perform emergency actions. | Governed by the **Optimism Collective**, which has two houses: the **Token House** (OP token holders who vote on protocol upgrades, incentives, etc.) and the **Citizens' House** (uses a reputation-based, one-person-one-vote system for public goods funding via Retroactive Public Goods Funding - RetroPGF). |
| **Ecosystem & Vision** | **Arbitrum One:** Focus on DeFi and general dApp use cases requiring high security. \<br\> **Arbitrum Nova:** Targeted at gaming, social applications, and other high-volume, cost-sensitive use cases. \<br\> **Arbitrum Orbit:** Framework for launching customizable Layer 3 chains that settle to Arbitrum L2s. | **OP Mainnet:** General-purpose L2. \<br\> **Superchain Vision:** A network of interoperable L2s (OP Chains) built using the **OP Stack** (a standardized, open-source development stack). These chains share security and a communication layer, aiming for horizontal scalability and a cohesive ecosystem (e.g., Base, Zora). |
| **Upgradeability** | Protocol upgrades are managed through Arbitrum DAO governance. The Nitro stack upgrade significantly improved performance and EVM compatibility. Stylus further enhances capabilities. | Protocol upgrades (like the Bedrock upgrade) are managed by Optimism governance. The OP Stack is designed for modularity, allowing components to be upgraded or replaced. |
| **Withdrawal Period** | Typically around **7 days** for optimistic rollups due to the challenge period for fraud proofs. Fast withdrawal solutions are available through third-party liquidity providers. | Typically around **7 days**, similar to other optimistic rollups, for the same reason. Fast withdrawal solutions via third-party bridges also exist. |
| **Token** | **$ARB** (Governance)                                                                                                                  | **$OP** (Governance and utility, e.g., for sequencer revenue distribution in the future)                                                   |

**Key Distinctions Summarized:**

  * **Fraud Proofs:** Arbitrum's multi-round interactive proofs are designed to be more efficient on L1 if a dispute occurs, while Optimism's single-round proofs are simpler conceptually.
  * **Virtual Machine:** While both are highly EVM compatible, Arbitrum's Stylus introduces WASM compatibility, broadening language support. Optimism has focused on achieving very close EVM equivalence.
  * **Ecosystem Strategy:** Arbitrum offers distinct chains (One, Nova) for different needs and Orbit for L3s. Optimism is building towards the "Superchain" concept with many interconnected L2s built on the OP Stack.
  * **Data Availability Options:** Arbitrum explicitly offers an AnyTrust model (Nova) with a DAC for lower fees at the cost of an added trust assumption, alongside its primary Rollup chain. Optimism's OP Stack allows for future flexibility in DA layers for OP Chains.
  * **Governance:** Both have token-based DAOs, but Optimism's Collective uniquely includes the Citizens' House for non-plutocratic public goods funding.

Both Arbitrum and Optimism are leading Layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum, continuously evolving and improving. The "better" choice often depends on the specific needs of a project, such as desired security levels, transaction cost sensitivity, developer tooling preferences, and ecosystem alignment.
