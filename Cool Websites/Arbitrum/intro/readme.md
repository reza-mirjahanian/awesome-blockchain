### Arbitrum's Core Solutions

-   Arbitrum offers two main solutions:
    1.  **Arbitrum Rollup**
    2.  **Arbitrum AnyTrust**

* * * *

### Arbitrum Rollup: Arbitrum One

-   **Chain Name:** Arbitrum One
-   **Mechanism:**
    -   Literally *"rolling up"* hundreds of transactions into one single, compressed transaction.
    -   This compressed transaction is then posted to the Ethereum main chain.
-   **Cost Savings:**
    -   The gas fee is spread among all transactions in the rollup.
    -   Sending or swapping ETH on Arbitrum costs **just a few cents**, compared to dollars on Ethereum.
-   **Execution Model: *Optimistic Execution***
    -   **Assumption:** All rollups are presumed to contain only legitimate transactions.
    -   **Validation Process:**
        -   Anyone can become an Arbitrum **validator** by running the proper software and staking some ETH.
        -   If a validator finds something suspicious, they can **challenge** it.
    -   **Incentive Mechanism:**
        -   **Malicious nodes** are penalized.
        -   **Challengers** earn crypto rewards.
    -   **Security Guarantee:** The chain remains secure as long as there is **at least one honest validator**.

### Arbitrum AnyTrust: Arbitrum Nova

-   **Target Users:** Developers and users (e.g., **gamers**) who:
    -   Need **even more speed** and **lower fees**.
    -   Are willing to sacrifice a degree of security and decentralization.
-   **Key Differentiator from Arbitrum One:**
    -   Transaction data is managed by a **20-member Data Availability Committee (D-A-C)**.
    -   The D-A-C posts **data certificates** to Ethereum.
    -   The system reverts to rollup mode *only when there's a transaction challenge*.
-   **Security Guarantee:** The chain remains secure if **at least 2 D-A-C members** are honest.
-   **Notable Use Case: Reddit Community Points**
    -   Reddit has built its Community Point system on Nova.
    -   **MOON tokens:**
        -   Earned in the `r/Cryptocurrency` subreddit as rewards for posts or comments.
        -   Can be freely **traded, tipped, or spent**.
        -   Tradable on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) like **ArbSwap**.

### Bridging to Arbitrum

-   **Arbitrum Bridge:**
    -   A collection of **smart contracts**.
    -   Enables the movement of **ETH** or **Ethereum tokens** between the Ethereum (Layer 1) and Arbitrum (Layer 2) chains.
-   **Transaction Fees on Arbitrum:**
    -   Paid in ETH that has been bridged to Arbitrum.
    -   This bridged ETH is sometimes referred to as **arbETH**.

-   **Wallet Connectivity:**
    -   Wallets like **Exodus** can be used to connect to any Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova Web3 app.
