FastLane on Polygon is an easy to integrate protocol that rewards participating validators for protecting the health of the Polygon blockchain.



Validators:
-----------

Earn revenue from arbitrageurs, liquidators, NFT traders, and more
------------------------------------------------------------------

Algorithmic traders (searchers) will bid in an auction for FastLane access during your sprints; the winning searchers will enjoy greater likelihood of successful trades without ever having a direct connection to your validator node

-   On validator nodes, keep running the official BOR repo. No patch required - just add one of the PFL sentries as a static peer. That's it!
-   On sentry nodes, keep running the official BOR repo - just apply a simple "PFL" patch after each official update
-   No transaction will ever be delayed beyond the current, default setting
-   Searchers won't know your peer ID, enode address, or IP address
-   Enjoy healthier nodes due to the reduction in bots' economic incentive to overwhelm your node with redundant transactions

#### Earn From Your Sprints

The winner of arbitrage opportunities during your sprints is currently decided by randomness. Our easy-to-implement protocol allows you to replace this randomness with monetization.


#### Ecosystem-Focused

Frontrunning transactions and "sandwich" attacks are not faciliated by the Fast Lane system.


#### Incredibly Simple Integration

One of the easiest integration processes on the market.


#### Standardizes transaction propagation

The removal of randomness from the tx propagation dynamic can potentially lead to lower data costs for your own sentry nodes



### After downloading our patch

Integrate your sentry nodes with one command line
-------------------------------------------------

No heavy software required.

Simply implement the provided FastLane patch with one additional command line during a BOR update.

(Note: patch is for Sentry nodes only. Validator nodes should use the official BOR repo without modifications)


### Join our list of approved validators

Participating validators will need to reach out to the FastLane team and be approved for participation.

### Integrate FastLane with our sentry patch

The provided patch can be ran after updating to the most recent BOR version. Integration would require only one additional command line before building.

### Begin earning revenue

Participants will begin to receive proceeds from the FastLane auctions at the end of the first full auction period after onboarding.
