# MEV and Skip: Optimizing Blockchain Mempools

## Introduction to MEV

* **MEV**: Maximal Extractable Value (formerly Miner Extractable Value)
* Concept originated from the "Flash Boys" research paper
* **2021 Revenue**: 
  - Ethereum: ~$1.2 billion
  - Across various roll-ups: ~$2 billion

### Key Characteristics of MEV
* Riskless and atomic capture of value
* Allows for infinite leverage on capital
* Keeps markets more efficient
* Accessible to young, independent searchers

## Skip: MEV Solution for Cosmos

### Background
* Cosmos natively uses first-come-first-served mempools
* Prior to Skip, MEV capture involved spamming mempools

### Skip's Features
1. Allows searchers to compete
2. Gives app chains and validators choice in MEV types
3. **Front-run and sandwich resistant**:
   - Compares signers of bundle submitters to transactions within bundles
4. Flexible reward splitting options:
   - Validators
   - Stakers
   - Liquidity providers

## Modular Mempools

### Traditional Approach
* Round-robin style
* Validators have own mempool copies
* Gossip transactions to each other
* Proposer chosen based on stake

### New Modular Approach
1. **Oracle Transactions**: Update prices
2. **MEV Section**: For searchers (using Skip)
3. **Order Book**: Central limit order book model
4. **Batch Auctions**: For MEV resistance
5. **Regular Transactions**: From RPC, potentially censorship-resistant

### Benefits of Modular Mempools
* Easily designed and implemented
* Customizable for different protocols
* Can be shipped out-of-the-box

## Skip's Role in Modular Mempools

* Runs simulation and ordering infrastructure
* Builds MEV sections for mempools
* Provides pre-simulated and auctioned bundles for insertion

### Challenges
* Need to simulate against:
  - Chain state
  - Most recent proposal
  - Other bundles
* Requires native deployments on different chains

### Future Possibilities with Celestia
* Cross-chain bundle submissions
* Atomicity guarantees across chains

## Implementation and Enforcement

* Can be encoded at the application layer
* Potential for slashing non-compliant validators
* Options for encoding payment preferences

## MEV Distribution and Chain Sustainability

* Flexible distribution of MEV rewards:
  - Validators
  - Liquidity providers
  - Users
* Can be adjusted based on chain needs and lifecycle stage

## Questions and Considerations

1. Skip's integration with consumer chains protocol
2. Opt-in vs. enforced usage of Skip
3. Balancing competition and preferences in MEV
4. Exploring mempool design space

## Conclusion

* Modular mempool design is an emerging area
* Protocols should have flexibility in designing mempools
* Competition among various parties for each mempool section is desirable
