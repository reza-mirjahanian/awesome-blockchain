## Barry's Talk on Skip Protocol

### Introduction
- Barry from Skip is presenting about "Many Chains, One Transaction."
- He is one of the co-founders of Skip Protocol.
- Skip builds transaction infrastructure in the Cosmos ecosystem.

### Background
- Skip's initial focus was on making chains more sustainable through MEV (Miner Extractable Value).
- They helped chains recapture their own MEV, benefiting Cosmos.
- They worked with Osmosis and Juno, helping validators recapture significant amounts of MEV.

### Shift in Focus
- Skip realized that MEV is a secondary problem in Cosmos.
- The primary issues are user experience (UX) and IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) UX.
- They simplified their focus, aiming to improve cross-chain transfers and swaps.

### Problems with Current IBC UX
- IBC UX is currently very painful.
- Users are forced to pick channel IDs, which is confusing.
- Developers face a steep learning curve with IBC protocols and concepts.
- This complexity discourages building applications in Cosmos.

### Skip API
- Skip announced the Skip API to simplify IBC for wallets, front ends, and applications.
- **Intelligent Pathing**: Reduces complexity by managing channel choices and routing.
- The API ensures correct routing for multi-hop transactions, making it seamless for developers.
- Developers submit an intent for the user, and the API handles the routing and packet tracking.

### One-Click Swaps and Transfers
- Skip API also supports any-to-any swaps.
- Users can swap tokens across chains in one click.
- The API aggregates liquidity from various sources for the best rates.
- The process is unified and simplified for both users and developers.

### Live Demo
- Barry attempted a live demo to show buying a "bad kid" (NFT) with Atom on the Hub in one click.
- The demo highlighted the simplicity and efficiency of the Skip API.
- Despite technical difficulties with the presentation setup, the demo was successful.

### Future Plans
- Skip plans to release more features in the coming weeks.
- They will integrate with more partners, starting with Kepler.
- Future features include fast relaying, multi-hop packet tracking, and more expressive cross-chain actions.
- The Skip API will remain free for developers, with optional affiliate fees.

### Conclusion
- Skip aims to grow the Cosmos ecosystem by simplifying cross-chain interactions.
- They encourage developers to chat with Skip team members if interested in using the API.

### Key Points
- Skip Protocol is focused on improving IBC UX in Cosmos.
- They developed Skip API to simplify cross-chain transfers and swaps.
- The API ensures correct routing and provides a seamless experience for users and developers.
- Future developments will expand the functionality and adoption of Skip API.

By addressing the complex user and developer experiences in the Cosmos ecosystem, Skip Protocol aims to make cross-chain transactions as simple and seamless as possible.
