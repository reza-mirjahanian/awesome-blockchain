## What Is Skip Protocol?

Skip Protocol is a blockchain infrastructure protocol that develops software to empower sovereign blockchains, validators, protocols, and users to capture Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) and determine how the profits are distributed. It offers a suite of tools that enhance user experience, interoperability, and value capture.

### Background

Barry Plunkett and Maghnus Mareneck founded Skip Protocol in 2022.

### How It Works

Skip Protocol operates through a sealed-bid, closed auction system in which traders submit tipped transactions to validators who prioritize them. It features an API for end-to-end interoperability, allowing developers to create cross-chain experiences for end users and a Block SDK for customizing blocks to specific use cases.

One distinct feature is Skipâ€™s Slinky, which runs on the chain validator set, improving application UX and providing full operational support. On-chain aggregation is done using ABCI++, which breaks down Oracle aggregation into secure and efficient steps. The Block SDK allows customization of block rules and transaction flow management systems, catering to various use cases.

### ðŸ”® Slinky[â€‹](https://skip-protocol-docs.netlify.app/#-slinky "Direct link to heading")

Skip builds  [Slinky](https://skip-protocol-docs.netlify.app/slinky/overview), an enshrined oracle for the highest-performance DeFi that leverages your chain's native validator set to provide the fastest, most secure on-chain updates, guaranteed every block.

If you're interested in integrating Slinky, please  **[contact us](https://skip.money/contact).**

### ðŸ§± Block SDK[â€‹](https://skip-protocol-docs.netlify.app/#-block-sdk "Direct link to heading")

We also build the  [Block SDK](https://skip-protocol-docs.netlify.app/blocksdk/overview), an open-source module that gives full control over how blocks are built, including a prebuilt MEV recapture mechanism, a EIP-1559 fee market, and segmentation to tailor blocks to your app-chain use case.

### What are Skipâ€™s products?[â€‹](https://skip-protocol-docs.netlify.app/about/faq#-what-are-skips-products "Direct link to heading")

-   ðŸ”®  **[Slinky](https://skip-protocol-docs.netlify.app/slinky/overview)**
    -   Slinky is an enshrined oracle that integrates with Cosmos chains using ABCI++ to provide a simple, secure, and reliable way to post data on-chain.
    -   It leverages chains' existing validator sets to secure posted data with the same set of security properties as CometBFT.
-   ðŸ”€  **[Skip API](https://api-docs.skip.money/docs)**
    -   Skip API is a unified REST/RPC service that helps developers create more seamless cross-chain experiences for their end users, across a variety of bridges.
-   ðŸ§±  **[Block SDK](https://skip-protocol-docs.netlify.app/blocksdk/integrate-the-sdk)**
    -   The Block SDK is a set of Cosmos SDK and ABCI++ primitives that allow chains to fully customize their sequencing with powerful use cases. It turns your chain's blocks into a  **`highway`**  consisting of individual  **`lanes`**  with localized fee-markets, MEV recapture, and more.

### ðŸ¤” How many chains is Skip currently live on?[â€‹](https://skip-protocol-docs.netlify.app/about/faq#-how-many-chains-is-skip-currently-live-on "Direct link to heading")
