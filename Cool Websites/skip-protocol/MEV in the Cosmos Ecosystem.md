# Understanding MEV in the Cosmos Ecosystem: Insights from Skip Protocol

Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) is a complex but crucial concept in the blockchain world, particularly as decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to grow. In a recent interview, the team behind Skip Protocol shared their insights on MEV in the context of the Cosmos ecosystem. Let's dive into the key points they discussed.

## What is MEV?

MEV refers to the profit that can be extracted by reordering, inserting, or removing transactions within a block. As Magnus from Skip explains:

"It basically refers to the ability of extracting some kind of profit from reordering transactions and inserting transactions and taking out transactions from an unconfirmed mempool."

This phenomenon exists on every blockchain to some degree, and the most effective solutions are economic, incentivizing fair play and revenue distribution to stakers.

## The Current State of MEV in Cosmos

While MEV is well-known in the Ethereum ecosystem, it's becoming increasingly relevant in the Cosmos ecosystem as well. The team highlights that as the cross-chain ecosystem in Cosmos grows, so will the opportunities for MEV.

Barry from Skip points out:

"As the cross-chain ecosystem takes off, the block space in Cosmos will get more and more valuable, and this competition is going to get more extreme."

## The Challenges of MEV

Uncontrolled MEV can lead to several issues:

1. Network congestion
2. Wasted block space
3. Poor user experience, especially during market crises
4. Centralization of profits to large players

## Skip's Solution

Skip aims to address these challenges by:

1. Creating an auction system for MEV opportunities
2. Distributing MEV profits back to stakers and validators
3. Reducing on-chain spam by moving competition off-chain
4. Making cross-chain MEV opportunities more accessible

Magnus explains their approach:

"Post Skip, what we do is we create an auction... We expect people to end up paying 80-90% to capture that arbitrage... and then that goes back to stakers and to the validator that was chosen to validate that block."

## MEV and IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication)

One of the most intriguing aspects of MEV in Cosmos is its potential interaction with IBC. Skip sees opportunities for making cross-chain transfers more efficient and profitable, potentially benefiting relayers and improving the overall user experience.

## Looking Ahead

Skip is working on bringing their MEV solution to the Cosmos ecosystem, with plans to launch on mainnet within 6-8 months. They're excited to connect with validators and users at the upcoming Cosmoverse conference to discuss MEV and its implications for the ecosystem.

As the Cosmos ecosystem continues to grow and evolve, understanding and managing MEV will become increasingly important. Projects like Skip are working to ensure that the benefits of MEV are distributed fairly and that the negative impacts are minimized.
