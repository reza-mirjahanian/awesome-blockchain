#### **Comparison to Proof of Stake (PoS)**

-   In **Proof of Stake (PoS)**, users stake tokens as collateral to propose blocks and earn rewards.

-   **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)** allows participants to delegate voting power to validators.

-   **Limitations of PoS**:

    -   Staked tokens reduce liquidity as they are locked up.
    -   Applications built on PoS chains have limited influence on chain security.
    -   Validators receive minimal rewards from the applications they support, leading to a **misalignment of incentives**.

#### **How Proof of Liquidity (PoL) Works**

-   **Validators**:

    -   Must provide a **BARA bond** to be eligible for block production.
    -   Once selected to propose a block, they direct **BGT emissions** to liquidity gauges of their choice, actively managing and supporting liquidity.
-   **Decentralizing Inflation**:

    -   New **BGT** tokens are emitted to liquidity providers, avoiding centralization seen in traditional PoS networks.
    -   Validators have an equal chance to produce blocks, but the amount of **BGT** emitted per block depends on the **BGT** delegated to them.
-   **Separation of Governance and Security**:

    -   **BGT** is non-transferable and earned through liquidity provision, used for governance and chain incentives.
    -   **BARA** is obtained by burning **BGT** and is used for network security and gas fees.

#### **Key Differences Between PoL and PoS**

-   **Collaboration**:

    -   In PoS, validators have little incentive to engage with protocols or users, leading to a fragmented ecosystem.
    -   In PoL, validators, protocols, and users must work together to maximize liquidity and benefits.
-   **Active Participation**:

    -   Validators direct **BGT rewards** to the most profitable liquidity pools, creating incentives to support protocols and users.
    -   Validators are **active contributors** to the network's growth, not just passive recipients of rewards.

#### **Roles of Ecosystem Participants**

-   **Validators**:

    -   Reach consensus on the chain state and earn **BARA** through gas fees and incentives for directing **BGT rewards** to liquidity pools.
-   **BGT Holders and Farmers**:

    -   Influence governance and economic incentives by delegating their tokens to validators.
    -   **BGT farmers** provide liquidity to profitable gauges and delegate **BGT** to validators for rewards.
-   **Bara Foundation**:

    -   Operates native dApps on Barachain that provide essential ecosystem services:
        -   **Beex**: A decentralized exchange (DEX) for swapping tokens.
        -   **Bend**: A borrowing and lending protocol.
        -   **Burps**: A perpetual contracts exchange (Perp DEX).

#### **Barachain Ecosystem Projects**

-   **Projects on Barachain**:

    -   Can incentivize validators like **Stako** to direct **BGT rewards** to their liquidity gauges.
    -   This promotes liquidity within projects and integrates them more deeply into the Barachain ecosystem.
-   **Alignment of Incentives**:

    -   **Validators**, **projects**, and **users** work together to increase the network's value.
    -   Validators are motivated to support high-liquidity projects, while projects gain more participation and liquidity.
