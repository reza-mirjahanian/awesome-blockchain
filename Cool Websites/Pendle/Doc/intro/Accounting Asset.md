> **"Accounting Asset: This is the asset that a yield-bearing token appreciates in value against. It is shown in brackets at the end of each market name."**

### Explanation:

An **"Accounting Asset"** is the **reference asset** or **denominator** used to measure the value growth of a **yield-bearing token**.

---

### Example Breakdown:

Letâ€™s say there is a **yield-bearing token** called `stETH` (which is staked ETH) in a market named:

> `stETH (ETH)`

Here:

* **`stETH`** is the **yield-bearing token** (its value increases over time due to staking rewards).
* **`ETH`** is the **accounting asset**.

This means:

* The protocol is measuring how much `stETH` is worth **in terms of ETH**.
* As `stETH` earns yield, its value **in ETH** goes up over time.
* So if 1 `stETH` was worth 1 `ETH` at the beginning, it might be worth 1.05 `ETH` later, showing a 5% yield.

---

### Why It Matters:

* It allows traders and protocols to **track the yield accrual** of a token **relative to a stable reference** (like ETH or USD).
* In markets or user interfaces, the accounting asset helps users understand **what the token is appreciating against**.
