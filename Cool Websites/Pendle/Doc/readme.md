# Pendle Finance and Its Competitors: Fixed-Yield DeFi Protocols

Pendle Finance is a decentralized protocol for trading on-chain **fixed-rate yields**. It lets users take any yield-bearing asset (e.g. a staked ETH token) and split it into two new tokens: a **Principal Token (PT)** redeemable 1:1 for the underlying asset at a future maturity, and a **Yield Token (YT)** capturing the asset’s variable yield (interest) up to that date. In Pendle’s model, PTs initially trade at a discount (reflecting detached future yield) and appreciate toward the asset’s full value as maturity approaches – this appreciation represents a **fixed APY** earned by PT holders. Conversely, YTs earn the actual yield from the asset (paid out in an intermediate “synthetic yield” token SY) but become worthless at maturity. By trading PTs and YTs in its AMM-like markets, Pendle users can **lock in or speculate on yields**.

Other protocols (Element Finance, Spectra formerly APWine, Sense Finance, etc.) use similar “yield-stripping” mechanisms: deposit an interest-bearing token and mint separate principal and yield claims. For example, Element also splits deposits into PT and YT (sometimes called eP and eY) over fixed terms (e.g. 3–6 months). Spectra (APWine) and Sense use PT/YT nomenclature (e.g. Sense’s tokens have prefixes `sP-` and `sY-`). These systems enable **fixed-rate savings** (buy PTs to lock yield) or **yield trading** (buy YTs to bet on future APYs). Notional Finance is a related fixed-income protocol using “fCash” bonds: it lets users lend or borrow at fixed rates via zero-coupon bonds that mature in the future.

Below we describe Pendle’s mechanics, tokenomics, and use cases in depth, then compare Pendle with Element, Spectra/APWine, Sense, and other major protocols across key dimensions. Citations to official docs and analyses are provided for all claims.

## Pendle Finance

**Yield Mechanism:** Pendle allows depositing interest-bearing tokens (e.g. austETH, wstETH, etc.) into its system and **minting PT and YT tokens** for a chosen maturity. For example, if you deposit wstETH, you receive an equal amount of *PT-wstETH* and *YT-wstETH*. The PT is redeemable for 1 wstETH (or underlying ETH) at maturity. The YT entitles its holder to all yield (staking rewards, interest, etc.) generated by that wstETH until maturity. In effect, the underlying token’s future cash flows are split: PT gives a fixed claim to principal, while YT gives the floating claim to interest.

**Fixed Yield Implementation:** The PT’s **return is fixed by its discount**: a PT costs less than 1 underlying now (since it gives up the yield), and grows in value to 1 at maturity. The **implied APY** for a PT is simply the annualized gain from buying it at a discount and redeeming at face value. For YT holders, the “implied APY” is the market price of YT – they profit if the actual yield earned on the asset exceeds the YT’s price. The Pendle protocol abstracts this via its AMM: PT and YT trade against each other and against a stable “Base” asset in Pendle LP pools, so market forces determine prices and yields.

**Token Structure:** Pendle’s own token **PENDLE** is a governance and reward token (max supply \~166M). Pendle also uses **vePENDLE**, a vote-escrow mechanism: users lock PENDLE for up to 2 years to obtain vePENDLE (which decays over time). Holding vePENDLE yields several benefits: voting on incentive allocation, receiving 80% of swap fees from voted pools, a base protocol APY, and “boost” on LP rewards. Crucially, protocol revenue (from yield fees and swap fees) is distributed to vePENDLE holders.

**Tokenomics & Incentives:** All team and investor tokens have fully vested as of late 2024; future supply inflation is dedicated to ecosystem incentives. Weekly PENDLE emissions (≈216K in Sept 2024) decline by \~1.1% per week until April 2026, then stabilize at a \~2% annual inflation rate. Emissions are voted by vePENDLE holders: each week they vote which pools to incentivize. The incentive **caps** for pools adjust based on fee performance (pools with high fee-share can earn higher rewards, up to a limit).

**Fees and Revenue:** Pendle charges: **5% fee on all yield** accrued by YT tokens (including “points” from partner protocols). It also charges **swap fees** on PT token trades (scaled by time to maturity). Both fees funnel to vePENDLE: 100% of yield fees go to vePENDLE stakers, and swap fees go to vePENDLE voters of the pool in question. (Currently, all revenue is passed to vePENDLE holders; no protocol treasury cut.) This aligns incentives so governance participants benefit from protocol growth.

**Supported Chains & Assets:** Pendle is **multi-chain**. Its UI notes support on Ethereum, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Optimism, and others. It has markets for many yield-bearing assets (Lido staked ETH, aTokens like aUSDC, Frax stables, Renzo zsTokens, etc.) on each chain. In short, Pendle aims to support virtually all major liquid staking and lending tokens across EVM chains.

**User Interface & Experience:** Pendle offers a web app (app.pendle.finance) with a dashboard showing markets and positions. The UI is relatively sophisticated: users can mint PT/YT or provide liquidity in PT-Base pools. There is no minimum lockup – positions can be entered or exited before maturity via the AMM. Pendle emphasizes a DeFi-native approach (using smart contracts and AMMs) rather than manual order books. The interface shows *Underlying APY* vs *Implied APY* and tools for managing positions. For beginners, it can be complex (many terms and choices), but education and guides are provided (e.g. Pendle Academy, docs.pendle.finance).

**Governance & Decentralization:** Pendle uses a DAO model with ve-token voting. Each locked PENDLE (vePENDLE) grants voting power, and voters direct weekly rewards. vePENDLE holders receive most protocol revenue, giving them skin in the game. As of 2025, governance appears operational, and votes (SIPs) can adjust parameters or revenue splits. The founding team still deploys new pools (per docs), but in principle any one could with governance. vePENDLE fosters decentralization by aligning long-term token holders with protocol success.

**Use Cases:** Pendle’s core use cases are: **fixed savings** (by buying PT at a discount, one can lock a fixed yield on a token without locking funds on a lending platform) and **yield speculation or hedging** (buying YTs to gain if actual yields rise above market price, or selling YTs if one expects yields to fall). For example, one could deposit stETH to mint PT and YT, then sell YT and hold PT to earn the fixed yield on stETH. Arbitrage opportunities also arise (e.g. if Pendle’s implied yield deviates from CeFi rates). LPs can earn trading fees by providing balanced pools of PT and base asset. Overall, Pendle bridges yield-bearing protocols and DEX-style markets, creating a “fixed income layer” for DeFi.

## Element Finance

**Overview and Mechanism:** Element Finance is another protocol for fixed-rate yields. It similarly **splits yields**: users deposit a “base asset” (e.g. ETH, BTC, USDC, DAI) that itself generates yield via Yearn or other vaults, and mint **Principal Tokens (PT)** and **Yield Tokens (YT)** for a chosen term (initially 3 or 6 months). PT holders can earn a fixed rate by buying PTs at a discount and holding to maturity. For example, if a Yearn ETH vault pays 25% APY, one could buy 1-year PT for that vault at a discount that implies locking in that rate. YT holders get the actual underlying yield (they redeem YTs after maturity to capture the realized interest).

**Fixed Yield Implementation:** Element uses **Balancer-based pools** (Convergent Curve Pools) as its AMM infrastructure. Each pool pairs PT with the base asset. The pool automatically adjusts weights over time so that at maturity all PT becomes effectively the base asset at 1:1. The fixed APY is determined by the PT price decay. Element terms (e.g. 3M, 6M) are fixed durations; when a term expires, PT redeems directly to the base asset. Users buy PT at a “discount” price that equates to a fixed interest rate. The protocol permits “flash minting” (minting PT+YT without prior holding by borrowing and repaying in one tx), enabling leveraged strategies without loans.

**Token Structure:** Element has its own governance token **ELFI**, which was a non-transferable (soulbound) voting token distributed via a ZK airdrop in 2022. Each ELFI grants one vote, and holders form a DAO (called the Element Council) to govern the protocol. Element’s design includes multiple voting vaults (e.g. for locking, vesting, council seats) allowing flexible delegation of voting power. Unlike Pendle’s ve-token model, Element’s current governance token is not inflationary (all ELFI were airdropped; there is no ongoing emission schedule). Future distributions or rewards come from treasury grants as decided by governance.

**Tokenomics & Incentives:** Since ELFI is not printed as rewards, Element used to rely on **LP incentives in other tokens**. Initially, integrated projects (Yearn, Curve) would route a portion of their yield to PT holders. For example, Yearn might direct some of its performance fees as PT rewards, but the details vary. Element did run liquidity mining campaigns in the past (e.g. ELFI rewards on pools), but now focuses on protocol usage. There is no prominent on-chain emissions like Pendle; governance sets incentives as needed. (ELFI distribution was capped by the airdrop.)

**Fees and Revenue:** The official docs and whitepaper do not prominently mention a protocol fee on yields. Element’s revenue model appears minimal: it may take a tiny fee on minting or maintainer rebates, but the system relies on integrated yield. Any swap fees collected by the underlying pool accrue to LPs (not to Element protocol itself). Thus, Element’s protocol has little built-in revenue; it is largely **revenue-neutral**, passing yields and fees to participants. This was a design choice to keep the protocol simple, but it means Element DAO does not earn on YT yields by default.

**Supported Chains & Assets:** Element launched on Ethereum (and Arbitrum) with focus assets ETH, BTC, USDC, DAI via Yearn vaults. Its flagship products involve Curve 3pool (ETH/BTC/USDT) and Yearn yETH vaults. It has since added other Yearn vaults (aAAVE, etc.). Element’s contracts are not highly multi-chain; the emphasis remains on Ethereum and Arbitrum. The supported yield-bearing tokens depend on Yearn and other vaults; currently Yearn’s major vaults form the base assets for splitting.

**User Interface & Experience:** Element’s app (element.fi or element.finance) offers “Fixed Yield Savings” pages where users can select a term and deposit vault tokens to mint PT/YT, then either hold PT or trade it. The interface is relatively straightforward: choose an asset/term, view the fixed APY, and mint. Element also provides an LP “Convergent Pool” dashboard for providing PT liquidity. User flow: deposit Yearn vault tokens → mint PT+YT → (optionally) swap YT for base assets to lock yield or hold YT for yield exposure. New features include “Yield Token Compounding” (YTC) which lets users use YT as collateral to buy more PT (leveraging yield). Overall, the UI is simpler than Pendle’s and focused on predetermined vault assets, but it does require understanding of Yearn vault mechanics.

**Governance & Decentralization:** Element is governed by its DAO (“Element Council”). ELFI holders vote on proposals via Snapshot/On-chain, with quorums and a multi-stage process. A notable feature is the **Governance Steering Council (GSC)**: delegates who hold at least 10% of ELFI can claim council seats with extra powers. Voting uses various vaults (e.g. locking vaults where users can stake transferable ELFI for additional weight). Element has decentralized control of protocol parameters (term lengths, cap adjusters, etc.). No single entity has unilateral power once active (aside from any multi-sig treasury controls), reflecting a community-driven model.

**Use Cases:** Element’s primary use case is **fixed-rate savings** on base assets. By depositing a vault position into Element, one can lock in the vault’s yield at a known rate – effectively turning variable yield into a fixed one. For example, put Yearn yUSDC into Element to get PT-yUSDC; selling YT and holding PT gives a fixed return on USDC. Alternatively, one can speculate on yield movements: buy YT to bet yields will exceed the fixed rate. Since tokens are tradable, these positions are liquid and can be closed early via the AMM. Element also allows leveraged yield exposure: as a LP, one can add PT/base to earn swap fees, or use YT as collateral. The permissionless nature of vault selection and term lengths also enables new strategies (developers can build products on top of Element’s pools).

## Spectra Finance (formerly APWine)

**Overview and Mechanism:** Spectra (the rebranded APWine) is an **interest rate derivatives protocol** for tokenizing future yield. Like Pendle, Spectra separates yield-bearing assets into PT and YT on top of ERC-4626 vault tokens. It supports **permissionless pool creation**: anyone can create a new market by specifying an ERC-4626 yield token and maturity. As with others, PT redeems 1:1 for principal at maturity, and YT collects yield until maturity, then becomes valueless. Spectra’s flagship app handles “fix rates” (buy PT for fixed returns) and “trade yield” (swap YT assets).

**Fixed Yield Implementation:** PTs represent a claim on a fixed amount of the underlying vault’s asset at maturity. When users buy PT, they implicitly lock in a fixed rate (the market sets the implied APY from price). Spectra pools use a design (similar to Pendle’s) that automatically reserves and distributes yield to YT holders and ensures PTs convert to underlying asset. Initially, Spectra was aimed at Ethereum yield tokens (e.g. Yearn, stETH, Aave tokens), but it is evolving to include assets across chains.

**Token Structure:** Spectra’s ecosystem token is **SPECTRA** (ticker SPECTRA), which replaced the old APW token in Dec 2024. It is an ERC-20, not locked, and follows a decreasing emission schedule (like APW’s). SPECTRA is used for governance (via Snapshot, with vote-escrow in development as veSPECTRA) and for liquidity incentives. Spectra also has a vote-escrow model: holders can lock SPECTRA for veSPECTRA. Early governance was off-chain (on Aragon snapshots) but has moved on-chain with SIPs for token migration and economics.

**Tokenomics & Incentives:** SPECTRA was introduced via an approved governance proposal (SIP-3) to migrate APW to SPECTRA and upgrade tokenomics. Emissions follow a decaying curve: initially \~1.75M per week (as APW had been), decaying 1.1% weekly, reaching a tail inflation of \~1.8% annually. Weekly incentives drop over \~2 years. veSPECTRA will allow locking with boosted rewards (a rebase mechanism pays locked holders from weekly emissions). Like Pendle, governance votes direct liquidity incentives to specific pools. Unlike Pendle’s 80/20 scheme, Spectra’s fee model rewards LPs directly: on swaps, **60% goes to veSPECTRA voters**, **20% to LPs**, and **20% to Curve DAO** (Spectra integrates with Curve’s voting power system).

**Fees and Revenue:** Spectra charges a **3% fee on all yield** (including staking “points”) accrued by YT tokens. Unlike Pendle’s 5%, Spectra’s lower yield fee is collected into the Spectra DAO treasury (to be used for further initiatives or redistributed). Swap fees (trading PT/base) go largely to veSPECTRA holders (60%) and partially to LPs (20%) and Curve (20%). Thus, Spectra both returns value to governance and gives LPs a slice of revenue, encouraging liquidity provision.

**Supported Chains & Assets:** Spectra is primarily **EVM-focused**. Its token SPECTRA is deployed on Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Arbitrum (with contract addresses listed). The protocol is chain-agnostic: any ERC-4626 vault token on a supported chain can have a pool. Spectra’s docs mention an app on Base layer. In practice, launched markets include Yearn vaults (USDC, WETH, etc.) on Ethereum and Arbitrum, and integration with Renzo (staked ETH on Base). The project emphasizes permissionless extensibility, so supported assets grow with user-created pools.

**User Interface & Experience:** Spectra’s web app (app.spectra.finance) provides a simplified workflow: users pick a vault token and term, then “fix rate” (buy PT) or “trade yield” (sell/buy YT). The UI also has liquidity vaults for LPs to earn fees and token rewards. It highlights a “fix your interest rate” feature, making the fixed-rate function user-friendly. Spectra’s design is somewhat modular: it focuses on enabling permissionless pool creation by anyone, whereas Pendle initially restricts pools to dev team. The interface is clean and educational, with clear explanations of fixed vs. variable rates, though like any yield protocol it requires understanding of maturity dates and token mechanics.

**Governance & Decentralization:** Spectra has a community-driven governance with SPECTRA token voting. Early governance allowed the APW→SPECTRA migration and setting the emission curve. The transition to SPECTRA suggests a maturing DAO. There is mention of future veSPECTRA (vote-escrow) to boost voting rights and rewards. The protocol aims for **permissionless creation**: anyone with SPECTRA can create new market pools through governance approval, aligning with decentralization. Unlike Element’s complex council, Spectra governance is a more standard token-vote DAO (via Snapshot/Aragon/GovernorAlpha).

**Use Cases:** Spectra enables the same fixed-yield and yield speculation use cases as Pendle. Users can fix interest or speculate on yield shifts, across any supported vault. Because it is permissionless, Spectra appeals to projects wanting custom yield products (e.g. a new staking derivative can have a Spectra pool created for it). It also targets “organizations” looking to manage cash flows by locking in yields. Since Spectra interfaces with Curve’s DAO (20% fee share), LPs also have incentive to participate. In essence, Spectra broadens APWine’s original idea into a more open protocol akin to Uniswap for yield derivatives.

## Sense Finance

**Overview and Mechanism:** Sense Finance was another protocol for fixed-rate yield on Ethereum. Like the others, it allowed **yield stripping** of tokens. Users deposited a yield-bearing asset (e.g. cDAI, COMP, stETH) and received a Principal Token (**sP-** prefix) and a Yield Token (**sY-** prefix) for a fixed term. The *sP* token traded at a discount and redeemed 1:1 for the underlying asset (via redemption pools) at maturity, providing a fixed APY. The *sY* token collected all the variable yield from the asset until maturity, then became worthless. Sense’s model closely mirrored the whitepapers of APWine/Pendle, with Space Pools where PTs and YTs were traded.

**Fixed Yield Implementation:** Sense pooled the principal tokens in its own AMM-like markets called “Space Pools.” The implied APY of a PT was shown to users; if one could buy 105 USDC one year out for 100 USDC now, that locked in a 5% fixed yield. The redemption at maturity was guaranteed via liquidity in the pools. Essentially, Sense created a market price for “future underlying” claims, similarly to Pendle.

**Token Structure:** Sense had a native token called **SENSE** (governance token) which could be staked for *Space Pools* LP and governance. However, it’s important that as of late 2023 the Sense project **ceased operations**. Its FAQ now warns “Sense Project is winding down and the UI will be deprecated in Q4 2023” and urges users to withdraw funds by Dec 1, 2023. All liquidity was drained and code support has effectively ended. Therefore, no ongoing tokenomics or governance models remain active for Sense.

**Tokenomics & Incentives:** While active, Sense tokenomics included SENSE distributions to LPs and a veSENSE model for boosting. However, since the project shut down, these are moot. In its brief life, Sense did not have a native emission after initial launch. There were no special yield fees mentioned publicly; it focused on giving yield tokens back to holders. Incentives for liquidity provision were in SENSE via veSENSE boosts.

**Fees and Revenue:** Sense did not prominently feature protocol fees. Its FAQ and docs do not cite any on-chain fees on yields or swaps, implying any yields were fully passed to YT holders (minus external protocol fees like lending interest). There is no evidence of a cut retained by a treasury. This means Sense DAO did not earn revenue; it relied on community enthusiasm.

**Supported Chains & Assets:** Sense was **Ethereum-only**. It supported a range of yield-bearing assets via adapters: cTokens (Compound), crvPOOL (Curve liquidity), wstETH (Lido), aTokens (Aave), and others through its “Sense Adapters”. Each series (asset+adapter) had its own maturity pools. No multichain deployment was ever announced.

**User Interface & Experience:** Sense’s UI (app.sense.finance) was functional but somewhat complex. It presented many “series” and maturity dates to choose from. Users minted sP/sY tokens then provided or traded them in Space Pools. A key feature was “rolling vaults” (continuously renewing fixed terms) but these are advanced. The experience was known to be developer-friendly but hard for novices. Also, because the project closed, the UI has been disabled. Before wind-down, Sense’s docs and medium posts offered educational content (e.g. “Why Sense?”, yield design blogs) to onboard users, but uptake remained low. Ultimately, the shuttering of the UI means Sense’s user experience is now moot.

**Governance & Decentralization:** Sense governance was intended to be token-vote via SENSE (and its ve-version). A DAO had been formed, but in practice core decisions came from the founding team. After the wind-down decision, the governance process did not continue. Sense’s model was intended to be open and community-driven, but it never achieved critical mass or truly decentralized control.

**Use Cases:** Sense offered the same theoretical use cases as Pendle/Spectra: fixed-income saving, yield speculation, and liquidity provision. For example, one could fix a yield on cDAI (Compound DAI) or bet on future ETH staking rates. Unique to Sense were creative products like *Series Pools* and *Rolling Liquidity Vaults* for yield farming. However, since it is defunct, these use cases no longer function in practice. (The closing of Sense was cited as due to low TVL and competition, which is a cautionary tale for any fixed-yield protocol.)

## Other Fixed-Yield Protocols

* **Notional Finance:** A prominent fixed-rate lending platform on Ethereum. Notional is not a yield “tokenizer” per se, but it lets users lend/borrow at fixed rates. It uses **fCash** tokens as zero-coupon bonds: e.g. a lender deposits 100 USDC and mints an fUSDC due in 6 months for 105 USDC; 105-100 implies the fixed interest. It maintains on-chain liquidity pools of USDC↔fUSDC, allowing users to trade instantly. Notional requires over-collateralized loans and has its own NOTE token for governance. Advantage: battle-tested, highly secure, with large liquidity (multi-\$100M TVL). Disadvantage: limited to certain maturities (mostly 3M, 6M, 1Y, 2Y), only supports a few currencies, and its fixed yields depend on market rates without tokenized yield splitting.

* **BarnBridge SmartYield:** A protocol (Ethereum) that offered fixed-yield bonds (“SY” and “PY” tokens). Users could deposit into “smart yield” pools based on Aave/Compound lending, splitting into **Senior Bonds** (fixed return) and **Junior Bonds** (residual yield). It’s similar conceptually but less flexible, and has seen low usage since its 2021 launch. BarnBridge is not active in yield markets today (it pivoted to NFT/band-marketplace).

* **88mph:** One of the first fixed-rate DeFi projects. On Ethereum, it allowed depositing certain tokens (e.g. aUSDC, stETH) to earn a fixed interest for a term. The fixed rate was calculated from a moving average of the lending yield. It had no PT/YT token structure; instead, it minted “MPH” vTokens representing the future payout. 88mph still operates in a limited way on Arbitrum. Advantage: simple fixed deposit; disadvantage: limited assets, no ongoing development.

* **Others:** Various lending platforms (e.g. Silo on Maple Finance, Euler) offer fixed-rate lending via vaults or per-loan terms, but these are more niche or CEX-like. Some new protocols (Voltz, Drift for interest swaps; Element’s “YieldTokenCompounder”) target fixed rates indirectly. For brevity, the main direct comparisons are above.

## Comparative Analysis

Each protocol has trade-offs in how it generates yield, handles fixed maturity, structures tokens, and incentivizes users. The table below highlights **key advantages and disadvantages** of each:

| **Other Protocols**  | BarnBridge’s SmartYield offered tranching of risk (fixed vs residual) on Aave/Compound debt. 88mph provided simple fixed-rate deposits on Ethereum.                                                                                                                                                                      | These have low activity/TVL now. Not permissionless or multi-chain. Often rely on centralized pools and have limited assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Each protocol’s **advantages** align with its design goals. Pendle leads in composability and multi-chain reach; Element focuses on simplicity and yield capture; Spectra emphasizes openness and low fees; Notional offers robust fixed-rate loans; Sense was innovative but is defunct. The **disadvantages** highlight trade-offs: fees, limited asset support, governance complexity, or project risk.

Overall, Pendle, Element, and Spectra share the core idea of splitting yield into tradable tokens, but they diverge in fee structure (5% vs 3% vs 0%), governance models (ve-token vs council DAO vs token-vote), and openness (team-curated vs permissionless pools). Fixed-rate lending protocols like Notional achieve similar goals with different mechanisms (no yield tokens, just fCash bonds).
