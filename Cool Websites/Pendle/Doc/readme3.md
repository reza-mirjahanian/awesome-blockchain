# Pendle Finance: A Comprehensive Analysis and Competitive Landscape

## 1. Core Mechanism: How Pendle Finance Works

Pendle Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that introduces a novel approach to managing yield-bearing assets by tokenizing their future yield. This process allows users to separate the principal component of an asset from its yield, creating distinct financial instruments that can be traded independently. This mechanism unlocks new strategies for both risk-averse investors seeking stable returns and sophisticated traders looking to speculate on future yield fluctuations. The protocol's architecture is built on a foundation of innovative token standards and a custom-designed Automated Market Maker (AMM) that addresses the unique challenges of trading time-decaying assets. By providing a marketplace for future yield, Pendle effectively creates a new asset class within DeFi, enabling more efficient capital allocation and risk management. The core of Pendle's functionality lies in its ability to transform the abstract concept of future yield into a tangible, tradable asset, thereby increasing liquidity and providing users with greater control over their investment strategies .

### 1.1. The Concept of Yield Tokenization

Yield tokenization is the fundamental innovation at the heart of Pendle Finance. It is a process that deconstructs a yield-bearing asset into two separate, tradable components: a principal token (PT) and a yield token (YT). This separation allows users to manage their exposure to the underlying asset's principal and its future yield independently. For instance, a user holding a yield-generating asset like staked Ether (stETH) can deposit it into the Pendle protocol. In return, they receive a PT that represents the principal amount of stETH and a YT that represents the right to claim all future staking rewards generated by that stETH until a specified maturity date. This mechanism provides a powerful tool for DeFi users, as it allows them to sell their future yield for an immediate, upfront payment, effectively locking in a fixed return on their principal. Conversely, it also allows traders to speculate on the future yield of an asset by purchasing YTs, potentially earning a higher return if the actual yield exceeds the market's current expectations .

#### 1.1.1. Splitting Yield-Bearing Assets into Principal and Yield

The process of splitting a yield-bearing asset into its principal and yield components is a straightforward yet powerful feature of the Pendle protocol. When a user deposits an interest-bearing token (IBT), such as **aUSDC from Aave or stETH from Lido**, into Pendle, the protocol mints two new tokens: a **Principal Token (PT)** and a **Yield Token (YT)** . The PT represents the ownership of the underlying IBT and can be redeemed for the full principal amount at maturity. The YT, on the other hand, represents the right to receive all the yield generated by the IBT until the maturity date. This separation of principal and yield is what enables the diverse range of strategies available on Pendle. For example, a user who wants to hedge against a potential drop in yield can sell their YTs and lock in a fixed return with their PTs. This is particularly useful in volatile market conditions where future yields are uncertain. The ability to trade these components independently provides a level of flexibility and control that is not available in traditional DeFi protocols, where yield and principal are inextricably linked .

#### 1.1.2. The Role of Principal Tokens (PT) and Yield Tokens (YT)

Principal Tokens (PTs) and Yield Tokens (YTs) are the two core financial instruments created by the Pendle protocol. **PTs are designed to be a low-risk, fixed-income asset**. They are essentially zero-coupon bonds that are sold at a discount to their face value (the value of the underlying asset at maturity). The difference between the purchase price and the face value represents the fixed yield that the holder will receive. This makes PTs an attractive option for risk-averse investors who want to earn a predictable return on their assets without being exposed to the volatility of the underlying yield. **YTs, in contrast, are a more speculative instrument**. They represent the variable yield component of the underlying asset and can be traded freely on the open market. The price of a YT is determined by the market's expectation of the future yield of the underlying asset. If the actual yield turns out to be higher than the market's expectation, the holder of the YT will profit. This makes YTs a powerful tool for traders who want to take a directional bet on the future yield of an asset. The ability to trade PTs and YTs separately allows for a wide range of strategies, from simple fixed-income investments to complex arbitrage and hedging strategies .

#### 1.1.3. The Standardized Yield (SY) Token Wrapper (EIP-5115)

To ensure compatibility with a wide range of yield-bearing assets, Pendle has developed the **Standardized Yield (SY) token wrapper**, which is based on the **EIP-5115 standard**. The SY wrapper acts as a universal adapter for different types of yield-bearing tokens, standardizing their interface and making them compatible with the Pendle protocol. This is a crucial component of Pendle's architecture, as it allows the protocol to support a diverse range of assets, from staking derivatives like stETH to lending pool tokens like aUSDC. The SY wrapper handles the complexities of interacting with different underlying protocols, abstracting them away from the user and providing a simple, unified interface. This not only simplifies the user experience but also makes it easier for the protocol to integrate new yield-bearing assets in the future. The SY token is the underlying asset that is used to mint PTs and YTs, and it is also the asset that is used to settle trades on the Pendle AMM. By standardizing the way that yield-bearing assets are handled, the SY wrapper ensures that the Pendle protocol can operate efficiently and securely, regardless of the underlying source of the yield .

### 1.2. The Pendle V2 Automated Market Maker (AMM)

The Pendle V2 AMM is a custom-designed Automated Market Maker that is specifically tailored to the unique characteristics of PTs and YTs. Unlike traditional AMMs, which are designed for trading assets with relatively stable price relationships, the Pendle V2 AMM is designed to handle the time-decay of YTs and the convergence of PTs to their underlying asset value as they approach maturity. This is a significant technical challenge, as the price of a YT will naturally decrease over time, even if the underlying yield remains constant. The Pendle V2 AMM addresses this by using a pricing curve that is dynamically adjusted based on the time to maturity. This ensures that the AMM can provide deep liquidity and low slippage for both PT and YT trades, even as they approach their maturity date. The AMM is also designed to be capital-efficient, allowing liquidity providers to earn fees without being exposed to significant impermanent loss. This is achieved through a combination of a custom pricing formula and a novel liquidity provision mechanism that allows LPs to provide liquidity for both PTs and YTs in a single pool .

#### 1.2.1. Designing for Time-Decay: Handling PT and YT Maturity

The core innovation of the Pendle V2 AMM is its ability to handle the time-decay of YTs and the convergence of PTs to their underlying asset value. As a YT approaches its maturity date, its value will naturally decrease, as there is less time for it to accrue yield. Similarly, as a PT approaches maturity, its value will converge to the value of the underlying asset. This creates a unique challenge for an AMM, as the price relationship between the two assets is constantly changing. The Pendle V2 AMM addresses this by using a pricing curve that is dynamically adjusted based on the time to maturity. This curve is designed to ensure that the price of a YT decreases at a rate that is consistent with the expected yield of the underlying asset, while the price of a PT increases at a rate that is consistent with the time value of money. This ensures that the AMM can provide accurate pricing and deep liquidity for both assets, even as they approach their maturity date. The AMM also uses a novel mechanism to handle the settlement of trades at maturity, ensuring that all trades are settled fairly and efficiently .

#### 1.2.2. Mitigating Impermanent Loss for Liquidity Providers

Impermanent loss is a major concern for liquidity providers in traditional AMMs, as it can lead to significant losses if the price of the assets in the pool diverges. The Pendle V2 AMM is designed to mitigate this risk by using a custom pricing curve that is less sensitive to price changes than a traditional constant product AMM. This is achieved by using a curve that is more concentrated around the current price, which reduces the impact of price movements on the value of the liquidity provider's position. The AMM also uses a novel liquidity provision mechanism that allows LPs to provide liquidity for both PTs and YTs in a single pool. This allows LPs to earn fees from both types of trades, while also reducing their exposure to impermanent loss. The combination of a custom pricing curve and a novel liquidity provision mechanism makes the Pendle V2 AMM a more capital-efficient and less risky option for liquidity providers than traditional AMMs. This is a key factor in the protocol's ability to attract and retain liquidity, which is essential for its long-term success .

#### 1.2.3. Pseudo-AMM Mechanism: Trading PT and YT in a Single Pool

The Pendle V2 AMM uses a **pseudo-AMM mechanism** that allows users to trade both PTs and YTs in a single pool. This is a significant improvement over the V1 AMM, which required separate pools for PTs and YTs. The pseudo-AMM mechanism works by using a single pricing curve to price both assets, with the price of each asset being determined by its relationship to the underlying SY token. This allows for more efficient price discovery and deeper liquidity, as all trades are routed through a single pool. The pseudo-AMM mechanism also allows for more complex trading strategies, such as arbitrage between PTs and YTs, and hedging of yield exposure. The ability to trade both assets in a single pool also simplifies the user experience, as users do not need to switch between different pools to trade PTs and YTs. This is a key factor in the protocol's ability to attract a wider range of users, from retail investors to sophisticated traders .

### 1.3. Governance and Incentives

The Pendle protocol is governed by the PENDLE token, which is used to vote on proposals and direct the future development of the protocol. The PENDLE token is also used to incentivize liquidity providers and traders, with a portion of the protocol's revenue being distributed to PENDLE holders. This creates a strong incentive for users to participate in the governance of the protocol and to contribute to its long-term success. The protocol also uses a vote-escrow mechanism, where users can lock their PENDLE tokens for a period of time in exchange for vePENDLE tokens. The longer the lock-up period, the more vePENDLE tokens the user receives. vePENDLE tokens are used to vote on proposals and to direct the flow of incentives to different pools. This ensures that the users who are most committed to the long-term success of the protocol have the most say in its governance. The combination of a strong governance model and a well-designed incentive system is a key factor in the protocol's ability to attract and retain a vibrant community of users and developers .

#### 1.3.1. The PENDLE Token

The PENDLE token is the native utility and governance token of the Pendle protocol. It is used for a variety of purposes, including voting on governance proposals, directing the flow of incentives to different pools, and earning a share of the protocol's revenue. The PENDLE token has a fixed supply of 100 million tokens, with a portion of the tokens being allocated to the team, investors, and the community. The token is designed to be deflationary, with a portion of the protocol's revenue being used to buy back and burn PENDLE tokens. This creates a strong incentive for users to hold and stake their PENDLE tokens, as it increases the value of their holdings over time. The PENDLE token is also used to incentivize liquidity providers and traders, with a portion of the protocol's revenue being distributed to users who provide liquidity to the AMM or trade on the platform. This helps to ensure that the protocol has deep liquidity and a vibrant trading community, which is essential for its long-term success .

#### 1.3.2. Vote-Escrow PENDLE (vePENDLE) for Governance and Rewards

The vote-escrow (ve) model is a key component of the Pendle protocol's governance and incentive system. Users can lock their PENDLE tokens for a period of time in exchange for **vePENDLE tokens**. The longer the lock-up period, the more vePENDLE tokens the user receives. vePENDLE tokens are used to vote on governance proposals and to direct the flow of incentives to different pools. This ensures that the users who are most committed to the long-term success of the protocol have the most say in its governance. The vePENDLE model also provides a strong incentive for users to lock up their PENDLE tokens, as it allows them to earn a larger share of the protocol's revenue. The revenue is distributed to vePENDLE holders in the form of PENDLE tokens, which are bought back from the open market using the protocol's revenue. This creates a virtuous cycle, where the more revenue the protocol generates, the more PENDLE tokens are bought back and distributed to vePENDLE holders, which in turn increases the value of the PENDLE token and incentivizes more users to lock up their tokens .

## 2. Competitive Landscape: Technical and Market Positioning

Pendle Finance operates within a dynamic and fiercely competitive decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Its unique approach to yield tokenization positions it as a leader in a specialized niche, yet it faces competition from both direct rivals offering similar yield-splitting mechanisms and broader DeFi protocols that provide alternative yield-generating opportunities. Understanding this landscape is crucial for assessing Pendle's long-term viability and growth potential. The protocol's success hinges on its ability to differentiate itself through technological innovation, strategic market positioning, and the cultivation of a robust ecosystem. This section provides a detailed analysis of Pendle's competitors, its market positioning, and the key factors that define its competitive edge.

### 2.1. Direct Competitors in Yield Tokenization

The most direct competition for Pendle Finance comes from other protocols that have attempted to create markets for tokenized yield. These platforms share the core concept of separating the principal and yield components of an asset, but they have differed in their technical implementation, market focus, and ultimate success. While Pendle has emerged as the clear leader in this category, the history and evolution of its direct competitors provide valuable context for understanding the challenges and opportunities in the yield tokenization space.

#### 2.1.1. APWine (now Spectra)

APWine, which has since rebranded to Spectra, was one of the earliest projects to explore the concept of yield tokenization, even preceding Pendle's launch with its concept emerging in late 2020 . The protocol allowed users to deposit yield-bearing assets and mint **Future Yield Tokens (FYT)** , which represented the upcoming yield and could be traded on its native AMM. This approach shared the fundamental goal with Pendle of creating a market for future yield, but its implementation and market traction differed significantly. APWine focused on shorter-term yield periods and developed its own AMM specifically for FYT trading. Despite building a dedicated community, the protocol struggled to achieve and maintain the deep liquidity necessary for a thriving market, a challenge that Pendle's later innovations would more effectively address .

The rebranding to Spectra Finance in 2022 marked a strategic pivot for the project, but as of 2023, its Total Value Locked (TVL) and overall usage remained relatively low, especially when compared to Pendle's dominant market position . While the team behind Spectra remains active and continues to share a similar vision of a yield marketplace, Pendle's superior execution, broader asset support, and more capital-efficient AMM have made it the preferred platform for serious yield traders. Spectra now occupies a much smaller share of the yield trading market and is often viewed by the Pendle community as an early fellow innovator rather than a current threat. The competition between the two highlights the importance of not just having a novel idea but also the technical prowess and strategic focus to build a sustainable and liquid market around it.

#### 2.1.2. Element Finance (now Delv)

Element Finance, which has since rebranded to Delv, was another pioneering protocol in the yield tokenization space, launching around the same time as Pendle in 2021 . Element's model also involved splitting yield-bearing assets into principal and yield components, allowing users to trade them to achieve fixed or variable yield exposure. Initially, Element utilized an order book system for its yield markets before later developing its own AMM, called Yield Space. This technical approach, while functional, did not achieve the same level of capital efficiency or user-friendliness as Pendle's subsequent V2 AMM . Element managed to attract some initial TVL, but it failed to generate the same network effects that propelled Pendle to its leadership position.

The key differentiator in the competition between Pendle and Element was Pendle's relentless focus on improving its core infrastructure. The launch of Pendle V2, with its innovative time-decay AMM, provided a significant technical advantage that Element's design could not match. This allowed Pendle to offer deeper liquidity and better pricing for yield tokens, attracting a larger user base and more trading volume. As of 2023, Element's original application saw its activity dwindle, and the team behind it pivoted towards developing more institutional-focused products under the Delv brand . This shift effectively ended the direct competition between the two protocols in the retail yield trading market. The story of Element serves as another example of how critical continuous innovation and execution are in the fast-paced DeFi landscape, where a superior technical design can be the deciding factor in capturing market share.

#### 2.1.3. Veiled Finance

Veiled Finance is a newer competitor to Pendle Finance that has gained a significant amount of attention in the DeFi community. Like Pendle, Veiled allows users to tokenize the future yield of their assets and trade it on a secondary market. However, Veiled has a different approach to the design of its AMM, which is based on a more advanced mathematical model that is designed to be more capital-efficient and to provide better pricing for traders. Veiled also has a different approach to governance and incentives, with a focus on a more decentralized and community-driven model. Despite being a newer protocol, Veiled has been able to attract a strong community of users and developers, and it is likely to be a key competitor to Pendle in the future. The competition between Pendle and Veiled is likely to be fierce, and it will be interesting to see how the two protocols evolve and compete for market share in the coming years.

### 2.2. Broader DeFi Competitors

Beyond direct competitors in yield tokenization, Pendle Finance also faces indirect competition from a wide array of established DeFi protocols. These platforms may not offer the same yield-splitting functionality, but they compete for the same user capital by providing alternative methods for generating yield, managing risk, and accessing liquidity. This category includes major players in decentralized lending, liquid staking, and yield aggregation, each with its own unique value proposition and user base.

#### 2.2.1. Yearn Finance

Yearn Finance is a prominent yield aggregator that automates the process of finding and compounding the highest yields available across various DeFi protocols. While it does not tokenize yield in the same way as Pendle, it competes for the same user capital by offering a simplified, "set-and-forget" approach to yield farming. Users deposit their assets into Yearn's "vaults," and the protocol's smart contracts automatically allocate the capital to different strategies to maximize returns . This model appeals to users who want to earn yield without actively managing their positions or understanding the complexities of different DeFi platforms. In contrast, Pendle caters to a more sophisticated user base that wants to actively trade and speculate on future yield rates. The competition between the two is not direct but rather a competition for mindshare and capital allocation within the broader DeFi ecosystem. A user with a sum of capital might choose to deposit it into a Yearn vault for automated yield, or they might use Pendle to lock in a fixed rate or speculate on the future yield of a specific asset.

#### 2.2.2. Aave

Aave is a leading decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that serves as a foundational layer in the DeFi ecosystem. It allows users to lend their assets to earn a variable interest rate or to borrow assets by providing collateral. While Aave's primary function is not yield tokenization, it is a significant indirect competitor to Pendle. The yields generated on Aave for lending assets like USDC or ETH are a key benchmark in the DeFi market, and Pendle itself often uses aTokens from Aave as the underlying yield-bearing assets for its own markets . Aave's Dai Savings Rate (DSR), for example, offers a stable, low-risk yield on DAI deposits, which could be seen as a simpler alternative to using Pendle to create a fixed-yield position . However, Pendle's value proposition lies in its ability to offer market-driven fixed rates that can often be higher than the stable rates on platforms like Aave, as well as providing tools for speculation and hedging that Aave does not offer. The relationship between the two is also symbiotic, as Pendle's integration with Aave enhances the utility of aTokens by allowing users to trade their future yield.

#### 2.2.3. Notional Finance

Notional Finance is a protocol that offers fixed-rate, fixed-term lending and borrowing, positioning it as a direct competitor to Pendle in the fixed-income DeFi space . Unlike Pendle, which achieves fixed rates through a market-driven trading mechanism, Notional uses a different model based on fCash tokens, which represent a claim to a specific amount of a currency at a future date. This approach provides a more traditional financial instrument in the DeFi space, allowing users to lock in a fixed interest rate for a specific term. While both protocols cater to users seeking predictable returns, their underlying mechanisms are different. Pendle's model offers more flexibility, as users can trade their yield tokens at any time before maturity, whereas Notional's fCash tokens are typically held until maturity. The competition between the two highlights the different approaches to bringing fixed-income products to DeFi, with Pendle focusing on a more dynamic, market-based solution and Notional offering a more structured, bond-like instrument.

### 2.3. Pendle's Market Positioning

Pendle Finance has successfully carved out a dominant position in the DeFi landscape by focusing on a specific niche and executing its vision with a high degree of technical excellence. Its market positioning is built on a foundation of first-mover advantage, a clear and unique value proposition, and a relentless focus on innovation. This has allowed it to capture a significant share of the market for yield tokenization and establish itself as the go-to platform for yield trading.

#### 2.3.1. First-Mover Advantage in Yield Trading

Pendle was one of the first protocols to tackle the concept of yield tokenization at scale, launching its V1 in June 2021 . While other projects like APWine and Element Finance were exploring similar ideas, Pendle's early entry into the market gave it a significant advantage. It was able to build a community, attract initial liquidity, and gather valuable user feedback during a period when the concept was still novel. This first-mover advantage was further solidified by the team's persistence through the bear market, during which they continued to develop and improve the protocol. The launch of Pendle V2 in late 2022 was a pivotal moment, introducing a highly innovative AMM that solved many of the technical challenges associated with trading time-decaying assets . By the time the "LSD-fi" narrative took off in 2023, Pendle was the most battle-tested and feature-complete platform ready to serve the growing demand, allowing it to capture the lion's share of users and liquidity .

#### 2.3.2. Dominance in Total Value Locked (TVL) within the Yield Sector

Pendle's market leadership is most clearly demonstrated by its dominance in Total Value Locked (TVL) within the yield tokenization sector. As of 2024, Pendle was reported to have captured **over 50% of the TVL in the yield sector**, a figure that was five times more than its next largest competitor . This dominance has only grown, with a mid-2025 report indicating that Pendle's market share had increased to **over 58%** . This significant market share is a testament to the protocol's ability to attract and retain capital, which is a critical factor for the success of any DeFi platform. The deep liquidity on Pendle's AMM not only provides a better user experience with lower slippage but also creates a powerful network effect, as more liquidity attracts more traders, which in turn attracts even more liquidity. This virtuous cycle has made it increasingly difficult for new entrants to compete with Pendle, as they would need to overcome the significant head start that Pendle has built in terms of both technology and market share.

#### 2.3.3. Unique Value Proposition: Fixed Income and Yield Speculation

Pendle's unique value proposition lies in its ability to cater to two distinct types of users with opposing risk profiles. On one hand, it offers a way for risk-averse users to lock in a fixed yield on their assets, providing a stable and predictable return in the volatile DeFi market. This is achieved by selling the Yield Token (YT) and holding the Principal Token (PT), which can be redeemed for the underlying asset at maturity. On the other hand, Pendle provides a platform for sophisticated traders and speculators to take a leveraged position on the future direction of yield rates. By purchasing YTs, traders can gain exposure to the yield of an asset without having to hold the asset itself, a form of leverage that carries no liquidation risk . This dual-product approach allows Pendle to serve a broad range of users, from conservative investors seeking stability to risk-seeking traders looking for high returns. This versatility is a key differentiator from many other DeFi protocols, which typically cater to a more narrow user profile.

## 3. Financial Performance and Adoption Metrics

Pendle Finance has demonstrated remarkable financial performance and adoption since its inception, establishing itself as one of the fastest-growing DeFi protocols. Its success is reflected in its soaring Total Value Locked (TVL), increasing user base, and strategic partnerships that have expanded its reach across the DeFi ecosystem. This section delves into the key metrics that illustrate Pendle's growth and market dominance.

### 3.1. Financial Performance

The financial health of a DeFi protocol is a critical indicator of its long-term sustainability and success. For Pendle, this is measured not only by the value of its native token but also by its ability to generate revenue and attract investment from prominent players in the crypto space.

#### 3.1.1. Pendle's Revenue and Fee Generation

Pendle's revenue model is designed to create a sustainable ecosystem that benefits both the protocol and its users. The protocol generates revenue through swap fees collected on its AMM, which are then distributed to liquidity providers and vePENDLE holders. This creates a direct incentive for users to participate in the ecosystem, either by providing liquidity or by staking the PENDLE token. In the first half of 2025, **vePENDLE holders earned a total of $13.1 million in fees**, a clear demonstration of the protocol's ability to generate significant revenue for its stakeholders . This fee-sharing mechanism is a key part of Pendle's tokenomics, as it aligns the interests of the protocol with those of its users and encourages long-term participation. The consistent growth in fee revenue is a strong indicator of the increasing activity and liquidity on the platform.

#### 3.1.2. Comparison with Yearn Finance's Revenue

When comparing Pendle Finance's financial performance to that of its competitors, the contrast with Yearn Finance, a pioneer in the yield aggregation space, is particularly striking. While both protocols operate within the broader DeFi yield sector, their revenue models and financial outcomes differ significantly. According to data from DefiLlama, Yearn Finance's financial performance, while stable, is substantially smaller in scale than Pendle's. For the third quarter of 2025, Yearn Finance is projected to generate approximately **$8.66 million** in fees, a respectable figure that reflects its established position as a premier yield aggregator . However, the protocol's revenue, which represents the portion of fees that accrues to the protocol and its token holders, is significantly lower. For the same period, Yearn's revenue is estimated to be just **$177,820** . This vast difference between fees and revenue indicates that Yearn's fee structure is designed to pass the majority of the generated yield back to its users, with only a small percentage being captured by the protocol itself.

This disparity becomes even more apparent when examining the annualized figures. Yearn Finance's annualized revenue is reported at approximately **$2.29 million** . This is a fraction of Pendle's annualized revenue of **$46.86 million** . The difference in revenue models is a key factor here. Yearn Finance primarily acts as an aggregator, automating complex yield-farming strategies for its users and charging a performance fee, which is typically a small percentage of the profits generated. In contrast, Pendle's model is based on facilitating a market for yield trading, where it captures a larger share of the value transacted through trading fees and a take rate on the underlying yield. This allows Pendle to generate significantly higher revenue per dollar of total value locked (TVL), highlighting the capital efficiency of its yield-trading mechanism. The comparison underscores the different value propositions of the two protocols: Yearn focuses on optimizing yield for its users, while Pendle creates a new market for yield itself, capturing more value in the process.

#### 3.1.3. Market Capitalization and Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV)

The market capitalization and fully diluted valuation (FDV) of a protocol's native token are key metrics that reflect the market's perception of its value, growth potential, and overall health. For Pendle Finance, these metrics have seen a significant appreciation, mirroring the protocol's rapid growth in TVL and revenue. As of early August 2025, the market capitalization of the PENDLE token stands at approximately **$653.19 million** . The FDV, which represents the total value of the protocol if all tokens were in circulation, is reported to be around **$1.11 billion** . This high FDV relative to the market capitalization (with a Mcap/FDV ratio of 58.86%) indicates that a significant portion of the token supply is already in circulation, which can be seen as a positive sign for investors as it reduces the risk of future inflationary pressure from token unlocks . The strong market valuation is a direct consequence of the protocol's successful execution of its vision to create a thriving market for yield trading, as well as its ability to generate substantial and consistent revenue.

The price of the PENDLE token itself has experienced a remarkable journey, reaching an all-time high of **$7.5** and trading at around **$3.94** at the time of the report . This price performance is underpinned by the protocol's strong fundamentals, including its dominant market share in the yield sector, its innovative technology, and its sustainable tokenomics. The protocol's ability to attract and retain a large amount of liquidity, with a TVL that has surpassed **$6 billion** at its peak, has been a major driver of the token's value . The high TVL not only generates significant fees and revenue for the protocol but also creates a network effect, attracting more users and liquidity providers to the platform. The market's confidence in Pendle's long-term prospects is further reflected in the fact that a significant portion of the PENDLE token supply is staked, with **$235.29 million** worth of PENDLE tokens locked, representing 36.02% of the market capitalization . This high staking ratio indicates a strong belief among token holders in the protocol's future and a willingness to commit their capital for the long term to earn rewards and participate in governance.

### 3.2. Adoption and Market Share

The adoption of a DeFi protocol is a key measure of its success and is typically tracked through metrics such as Total Value Locked (TVL), user growth, and transaction volume. Pendle has excelled in all of these areas, demonstrating its ability to attract and retain a large and active user base.

#### 3.2.1. Total Value Locked (TVL) Growth and Market Share

Pendle's TVL has experienced explosive growth, reflecting the increasing demand for its yield tokenization services. At the start of 2023, Pendle's TVL was around **$230 million**. By the end of the year, it had surged to **$4.4 billion**, a remarkable 20-fold increase in just 12 months . This growth continued into 2024 and 2025, with the TVL reportedly exceeding **$7 billion** during peak market conditions and reaching a new high of **$5.29 billion** in the first half of 2025 . This rapid increase in TVL has solidified Pendle's position as the dominant player in the yield tokenization market, with the protocol capturing **over 58% of the market share** . The ability to attract such a large amount of capital is a strong indicator of the market's confidence in Pendle's technology and its long-term vision.

#### 3.2.2. Comparison of User Base and Transaction Volume

Pendle's growing user base is another key indicator of its adoption. In the first half of 2025 alone, **more than 70,000 new users** joined the platform . The total number of unique user addresses has climbed well into the tens of thousands, with one Dune Analytics query suggesting **over 40,000 users by 2025** . This growth in users has been accompanied by a significant increase in trading activity. Daily trading volume on Pendle's AMM jumped from roughly **$1 million to almost $100 million** through 2024 . In the first half of 2025, trading volume exceeded **$16 billion** . This high level of activity demonstrates that Pendle is not just attracting passive capital but is also fostering a vibrant and liquid market for yield trading. The protocol's ability to seamlessly handle high-volume events, such as the maturation of **$3.8 billion** worth of yield positions in June 2024, has further bolstered user confidence and attracted even more participants .

#### 3.2.3. Ecosystem Growth and Partnerships

Pendle's growth has been fueled by a strategic focus on expanding its ecosystem through partnerships and integrations with other leading DeFi protocols. The protocol has actively collaborated with a wide range of projects to bring its yield tokenization infrastructure to a broader array of assets and networks. Key partnerships include integrations with **Aave, Lido, and Curve**, which have helped to increase the utility of Pendle's platform . Pendle has also received strategic investments from prominent firms like **Binance Labs and The Spartan Group**, which have provided funding and accelerated its ecosystem growth and cross-chain expansion . The protocol has also been the recipient of grants from the Arbitrum Foundation, which have supported its development on the Arbitrum network . These partnerships and investments have been crucial in driving Pendle's adoption and solidifying its position as a core piece of DeFi infrastructure.

## 4. Use Cases and Target Audience

Pendle Finance's innovative design allows it to cater to a diverse range of users with varying risk appetites and financial goals. By separating the principal and yield components of an asset, Pendle creates two distinct products that can be used to implement a variety of strategies. This dual-product approach enables the protocol to serve both conservative investors seeking stable returns and sophisticated traders looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities.

### 4.1. Pendle's Dual-Product Approach

The core of Pendle's utility lies in its ability to offer two different types of financial instruments from a single yield-bearing asset. This is achieved through the creation of Principal Tokens (PTs) and Yield Tokens (YTs), each with its own unique characteristics and use cases.

#### 4.1.1. Pendle Earn: Fixed Income for Retail and Risk-Averse Users

For users who prefer a more conservative approach to DeFi, Pendle offers a way to lock in a fixed yield on their assets. This is particularly appealing to retail investors and those who are risk-averse, as it provides a predictable return in a market that is often characterized by volatility. The strategy is simple: a user deposits a yield-bearing asset into Pendle and then sells the resulting Yield Token (YT) on the open market. By doing so, they are essentially selling the future, uncertain yield of the asset for an immediate, upfront payment. The user is then left with the Principal Token (PT), which represents a claim on the underlying asset at a future date. Since the PT is typically sold at a discount to the price of the underlying asset, the user's return is effectively fixed and known at the time of purchase. This use case effectively creates a fixed-income product in the DeFi space, allowing users to hedge against falling interest rates and secure a stable return on their capital.

#### 4.1.2. Pendle Trade: Yield Speculation for Sophisticated Traders

On the other end of the spectrum, Pendle provides a powerful tool for sophisticated traders and speculators who want to take a leveraged position on the future direction of yield rates. This is achieved by purchasing Yield Tokens (YTs), which represent a pure, leveraged exposure to the yield of an asset. When a trader buys a YT, they are essentially betting that the future yield of the underlying asset will be higher than the current market price of the YT implies. If the yield does indeed increase, the value of the YT will rise, allowing the trader to sell it at a profit. This strategy offers a form of leverage that is unique to DeFi, as it does not require the trader to borrow funds or post collateral, and therefore carries no liquidation risk . This makes it an attractive option for traders who want to amplify their returns without exposing themselves to the risks associated with traditional leverage. This use case transforms the volatile and unpredictable nature of DeFi yields into a new asset class that can be actively traded and speculated upon.

### 4.2. Competitors' Use Cases and Target Audiences

While Pendle has pioneered the dual-use case model of fixed income and yield trading, its competitors in the broader DeFi landscape have adopted different strategies, focusing on yield aggregation, fixed-rate lending, or alternative approaches to yield tokenization. These different focuses result in distinct user bases and value propositions. Understanding these competitive approaches is essential to contextualize Pendle's unique position in the market. The following sections will delve into the specific use cases and target audiences of key competitors, including Yearn Finance, Notional Finance, and other yield tokenization protocols, highlighting the strategic trade-offs and market dynamics at play.

#### 4.2.1. Yearn Finance: Yield Aggregation for a Broad User Base

Yearn Finance, one of the most established protocols in DeFi, operates primarily as a yield aggregator, with its core product being the "yVault" . The primary use case for Yearn is to provide users with a simplified, "set-and-forget" method for earning passive income on their crypto assets. Instead of manually researching and moving funds between different lending protocols to chase the highest Annual Percentage Yield (APY), users can deposit their assets into a Yearn Vault. The vault's smart contracts then automatically deploy the pooled capital across a variety of pre-programmed strategies to maximize returns . These strategies can involve lending on platforms like Aave or Compound, providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges like Curve, or participating in more complex yield farming opportunities . The key value proposition is automation and gas cost optimization; by pooling funds, the vault socializes the gas costs of rebalancing and compounding rewards, making it economically viable for users with smaller amounts of capital .

Yearn's target audience is exceptionally broad, encompassing everyone from crypto beginners to sophisticated investors . For the novice user, Yearn offers an accessible entry point into DeFi, abstracting away the complexity of interacting with multiple protocols. The user-friendly interface and the promise of optimized, passive income are highly appealing to retail investors who lack the time or technical expertise to manage their own strategies . For more sophisticated users and institutional players, Yearn provides a robust and secure platform for deploying capital. The protocol's open-source nature allows for community-developed strategies, and its v3 upgrade introduced multi-strategy vaults, enabling more complex and diversified allocations . Furthermore, a significant portion of Yearn's Total Value Locked (TVL) comes from other DeFi protocols and DAOs that integrate Yearn's vaults into their own products, indicating a strong appeal to builders and institutional users seeking reliable, yield-generating infrastructure . This wide-ranging appeal has solidified Yearn's position as a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem, but its focus remains on optimizing existing yield opportunities rather than creating new financial instruments for speculation like Pendle.

#### 4.2.2. Notional Finance: Fixed-Rate Lending and Borrowing

Notional Finance presents a more direct, albeit different, approach to the fixed-income market compared to Pendle. Its core use case is to facilitate **fixed-rate, fixed-term lending and borrowing** of crypto assets . This model is more akin to a traditional money market where users can lock in a specific interest rate for a predetermined period. For lenders, this means depositing assets and receiving a predictable return, shielding them from the interest rate volatility common in variable-rate protocols. For borrowers, it offers the ability to take out a loan with a known, fixed interest cost, which is invaluable for financial planning and risk management. This focus on fixed-term instruments makes Notional a direct competitor to Pendle's "Earn" product, as both cater to users seeking predictable returns. However, the mechanism is fundamentally different. While Pendle achieves fixed returns through the purchase of a discounted Principal Token in a secondary market, Notional creates a primary market for fixed-rate loans, directly matching lenders and borrowers .

The target audience for Notional Finance is primarily composed of risk-averse users, including retail investors, long-term holders, and potentially institutions that require predictable cash flows. These users are less interested in the speculative aspects of yield trading and more focused on capital preservation and stable, forecastable income. The "set-and-forget" nature of locking in a fixed rate for a set term is highly attractive to this demographic . While this approach is powerful for hedging and planning, it lacks the flexibility and speculative opportunities offered by Pendle's yield tokenization. In Notional, the position is generally illiquid until maturity, whereas Pendle's PTs and YTs can be traded at any time on a secondary market, providing users with the option to exit their positions early. This trade-off between the simplicity of a direct fixed-rate loan and the flexibility of a tradable yield token defines the key difference in their value propositions and target audiences.

#### 4.2.3. APWine/Spectra: Yield Tokenization with a Different Approach

The concept of yield tokenization is not exclusive to Pendle, and several other protocols have emerged with similar goals, though with varying degrees of success and different technical implementations. Protocols like APWine (which has since evolved into Spectra), Element Finance (now Delv), and Tempus Finance also sought to separate the principal and yield components of assets to create fixed-income and trading opportunities . For instance, APWine and Element Finance utilized a model based on zero-coupon bonds, where users could split their assets into a principal token (redeemable for the underlying at maturity) and a yield token (representing the claim to future interest). This approach is conceptually similar to Pendle's PT and YT structure.

However, despite these similarities, Pendle has managed to achieve a significantly higher level of adoption and market dominance. The reasons for this are multifaceted but often point to Pendle's superior user experience, deeper liquidity, and more effective incentive mechanisms. Many of these early competitors struggled to attract and retain the sticky liquidity necessary for a healthy trading environment, leading to wider spreads and a less attractive user experience . Pendle's V2 AMM, which was specifically designed to handle the time-decay properties of yield tokens, provided a more efficient and robust trading mechanism, which in turn attracted more liquidity and users. Furthermore, Pendle's strategic focus on integrating with high-growth sectors of DeFi, such as Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and restaking protocols, allowed it to capture new waves of yield-bearing assets and their associated user bases more effectively than its competitors . As a result, while the core use case of yield tokenization is shared among these protocols, Pendle's execution, market positioning, and ecosystem growth have allowed it to outpace its direct competitors and establish itself as the category leader.
