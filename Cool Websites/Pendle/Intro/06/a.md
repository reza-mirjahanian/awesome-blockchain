# 💎 Points Trading on Pendle

---

## 🎁 What is Points Trading?

* *Inspired by credit card point systems*—earn points by participating in DeFi protocols.
* **Points = speculative rewards**, often redeemed later as **airdrops**.
* On **Pendle**, points accrue to **Yield Token (YT)** holders until maturity.

### Token Split Example

A point-bearing asset like `eETH` is split into:

* **PT (Principal Token)** – redeemable for base asset at maturity.
* **YT (Yield Token)** – receives *all* yield and points until maturity.

---

## ⚖️ PT vs. YT: A Trade-Off

| **PT (Principal Token)**          | **YT (Yield Token)**                   |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Fixed yield                       | Variable points + yield                |
| No exposure to airdrop volatility | High upside, decays to \$0 at maturity |
| Predictable returns               | Speculative, time-sensitive            |

PT buyers give up all yield & points  
YT buyers absorb decay for high point rewards

## 🔁 Strategy #1: Leverage Points via **YT**

### Example: Using 1 ETH

* Deposit 1 ETH into Pendle
* Swap it for **10 YT-eETH**
* Now you earn **10× points** from just 1 ETH

> *YT lets you farm points at scale from the same capital.*

### Why It Works

* **YT captures** the full yield and points stream
* With **protocol multipliers**, you may earn:

  * 📈 20× or even 30× points with the same capital

### Caveat

* YT *decays over time* as maturity approaches
* Implied APY may fluctuate—watch for favorable exits

---

## 🧮 How to Value Points?

* There's **no guaranteed value**—depends on future airdrops.

* Many early adopters have profited, but:

* Use **implied APY** as a proxy for market’s confidence in future point value

## 🪙 Strategy #2: Fixed Yield with **PT**

### Example: PT-eETH

* Buy 1 PT-eETH → Redeem 1 ETH at maturity
* Sacrifice **points and yield** for **guaranteed gain**

### Why Use PTs?

* No concern over airdrop speculation
* Returns are:

  * **Predictable**
  * **Higher than spot ETH**
  * **Zero management needed**

> *A popular strategy among whales seeking stable growth.*

## 💧 Strategy #3: Liquidity Provision (LP) on Pendle

### What’s Inside an LP?

* **50% PT** → Fixed yield
* **50% base asset (e.g., eETH)** → Full yield + points
* Earn:

  * 🔁 Swap fees
  * 🎯 Pendle incentives
  * 🎉 Bonus point multipliers

### Think of it as:

HODL ETH + Earn everything possible on top

## 🧠 LP = Best of Both Worlds

| Benefit                 | Source                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Fixed yield             | From PT half              |
| Point farming           | From base asset half      |
| Additional rewards      | Swap fees + Pendle tokens |
| Bonus point multipliers | Protocol incentives       |

### Pro Tip:

* ✅ Enable **Zero Price Impact Mode** when LPing for maximum point gain
* 🔒 Lock Pendle tokens (via **Pendle**, **Penpie**, or **Equilibria**) to **boost** rewards

---

## ⚙️ Example Setup for LP Farming

```text
1. Provide 1 ETH as LP → Splits into 0.5 PT + 0.5 eETH
2. Earn:
   - Fixed yield from PT
   - Yield + points + multipliers from eETH
   - Swap fees + PENDLE incentives
3. Boost yield by locking PENDLE or using liquid lockers
```

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

* **Pendle does not issue airdrops** — only enables point accumulation.
* **YT = speculative** — only buy if you're confident in point value.
* **PT = safe & predictable** — great for conservative capital.
* **LP = hybrid** — ideal for exposure to both yield and points.

> *All point multipliers come from the **underlying protocol**—contact them for disputes.*
