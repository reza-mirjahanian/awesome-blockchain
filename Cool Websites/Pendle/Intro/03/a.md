# 📈 **10x Your Yield Exposure with Pendle YT**

---

## 💥 **What Is YT (Yield Token)?**

* **YT (Yield Token)** grants you the *right to receive future yield* from a yield-bearing asset.
* **Example**:

  * 1 `YT-stETH` earns all future yield from 1 `stETH`
  * Buy it for *a fraction* of the full asset’s value

```text
stETH APY = 4% → 1 YT-stETH = ~0.04 ETH over 1 year
```

---

## 📊 **How YT Works on Pendle**

1. **YT separates the yield** from the principal (PT)
2. You **purchase YT** to speculate on yield rising
3. You earn all **future yield** generated by the asset

💡 *If yield goes up — your YT becomes more valuable*

---

## 🧠 **Key Concepts: Underlying APY vs Implied APY**

### 🔹 *Underlying APY*

* The **actual current yield** earned by holding the underlying asset
* Example: stETH earns **3.7%** APY (variable)

### 🔹 *Implied APY*

* The **market-determined yield expectation**, reflected in YT pricing
* Functions like the *“price”* of future yield

```text
YT priced at implied APY = 3.5% → Market expects 3.5% future APY
```

## 🔁 **Profit Scenarios When Trading YT**

### ✅ **1. Underlying APY Increases**

* Buy YT at **3.5% implied APY**
* Actual average yield = **4.2%**
* You earn **more** than you paid for → profit

### ✅ **2. Implied APY Increases**

* Buy YT at **3.5%**
* Market demand pushes price up → Implied APY = **5%**
* Sell YT for a profit before maturity

---

## 📈 **YT = Long Yield Position**

* Buying YT is a **bullish bet on rising yield**
* You benefit when:

  * **Staking rewards go up**
  * **Protocol revenues increase**
  * **Burn rate increases** (e.g., EIP-1559 ETH burn)

---

## 🔬 **What Drives Yield?**

* **Staking Trends**
  → More stakers = lower APY
  → Fewer stakers = higher APY

* **Token Burn Dynamics**
  → More burn = fewer tokens = higher yield

* **On-chain activity**
  → Gas usage, trading volumes, etc.
