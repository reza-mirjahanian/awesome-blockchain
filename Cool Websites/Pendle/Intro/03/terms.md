# ðŸ“š **Pendle YT Glossary**

### **Yield Token (YT)**

A tokenized right to receive all future yield from a yield-bearing asset until maturity. Tradable independently from the principal.

---

### **Implied APY**

The *market-implied annual yield* based on the current price of YT. Reflects consensus on expected future yield of the underlying asset.

---

### **Underlying APY**

The *actual variable annual yield* generated by the asset itself (e.g., stETH), typically influenced by staking rewards or protocol activity.

---

### **Long Yield Position**

A trading stance where you *profit if future yields increase*. Buying YT is a long yield position because it benefits from higher APY.

---

### **Yield Exposure**

The degree to which your portfolioâ€™s value depends on yield changes. Buying YT increases yield exposure, often with higher leverage.

---

### **Pendle Yield Calculator**

A built-in tool on Pendle that estimates *net profit and effective APY* based on different assumptions about future yields and duration.

---

### **Staking Participation**

The percentage of total supply that is staked in a network like Ethereum. Changes in participation affect staking rewards (yield).

---

### **EIP-1559 Burn**

Ethereumâ€™s mechanism that *burns a portion of transaction fees*, reducing token supply and potentially increasing staking yield.

---

### **Price Impact**

The deviation in token price due to trade size within the AMM pool. Higher impact = less favorable execution price.

---

### **AMM Pool (Automated Market Maker)**

A decentralized liquidity mechanism where trades are executed against smart contract-based reserves rather than order books.

---

### **Yield Trading**

A strategy of *speculating on future yield changes* using YT or PT tokens. Profit is made from yield direction, not just price movement.

---

### **Claimable Yield**

The *accumulated yield* that a YT holder is entitled to withdraw, shown in the user dashboard on Pendle.

---

### **Effective Implied APY**

The adjusted implied APY you actually receive after accounting for *price slippage* and *fees* during the trade execution.

---

### **Break-even Yield**

The minimum average APY required from the underlying asset for your YT position to be *profitable* by maturity.

---

### **Yield Tokenization**

The process of *splitting a yield-bearing asset* into PT (principal) and YT (yield) tokens to enable flexible yield strategies.
