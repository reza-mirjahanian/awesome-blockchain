# ðŸ“˜ Glossary of Advanced Pendle Concepts

---

### **Principal Tokens (PTs)**

*Tokens that represent the base assetâ€™s value, minus future yield.*
Holding PTs entitles you to receive the full value of the underlying asset at maturity.

---

### **Yield Tokens (YTs)**

*Tokens that represent the right to future yield from an asset.*
Traded separately from PTs on Pendle, allowing speculation or hedging on future yields.

---

### **Implied APY (Annual Percentage Yield)**

*The projected annual return implied by the current market price of YT or PT.*
It reflects market expectations of the asset's future yield.

---

### **Delta Neutral Strategy**

*A portfolio setup where opposing positions cancel out price exposure.*
Used to earn passive income without directional market risk.

---

### **Liquidity Provision (LP) Position**

*Supplying a pair of tokens to Pendleâ€™s AMM to facilitate trades.*
Earns swap fees and incentives, often paired with PT and YT trading.

---

### **Shorting (Short Position)**

*Borrowing an asset to sell it, with the intention of buying it back later at a lower price.*
Used in delta-neutral setups to offset long exposure.

---

### **Funding Rate**

*Recurring payments exchanged between long and short positions on perpetual futures markets.*
Positive rates reward short sellers; crucial in delta-neutral yield farming.

---

### **Leveraged Fixed Yield**

*Earning amplified returns by borrowing assets to buy more PTs.*
Increases exposure to yield but also raises liquidation risk.

---

### **Collateral**

*Assets locked in a lending protocol to borrow against.*
PTs and LP tokens can be used as collateral in supported money markets.

---

### **Looping**

*The process of repeatedly borrowing to reinvest in the same asset.*
Used to amplify yield exposure but exponentially increases risk.

---

### **Price Impact**

*The effect of a trade on the market price of an asset due to liquidity constraints.*
Pendleâ€™s limit orders eliminate price impact by matching orders off-chain.

---

### **Limit Order**

*An order to buy or sell a token at a specific price or better.*
On Pendle, it allows setting yield-based entry/exit points (via implied APY).

---

### **Pendle AMM (Automated Market Maker)**

*A custom liquidity engine that enables trading between PTs, YTs, and base assets.*
Supports programmable yield trading with zero slippage for limit orders.

---

### **Maturity**

*The point in time when PT holders receive the full underlying asset.*
YTs expire worthless at this point, and PTs redeem the full value.
