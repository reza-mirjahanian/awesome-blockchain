# Glossary of Key Terms

* **Impermanent Loss (IL)**
    A potential loss in value experienced by liquidity providers in an AMM. It's the difference between holding assets in a pool versus holding them in a wallet, caused by asset price divergence.

* **Automated Market Maker (AMM)**
    A decentralized exchange protocol that uses mathematical formulas and liquidity pools to price assets and facilitate trades, removing the need for traditional order books.

* **Yield-Bearing Asset**
    A digital token that inherently generates yield, such as a staked token like Lido's `stETH` which earns staking rewards, or a token deposited in a lending protocol.

* **Principal Token (PT)**
    Represents the principal portion of a deposited yield-bearing asset. It is redeemable 1:1 for the underlying asset at a future date (**Maturity**) and trades at a discount before then.

* **Yield Token (YT)**
    Represents the right to all future yield generated by a deposited asset until its **Maturity**. `YT` allows users to speculate on or hedge against changes in yield rates.

* **Standard Yield Token (SY)**
    A wrapped version of an underlying yield-bearing asset, making it compatible with the Pendle protocol's smart contracts. It is functionally equivalent to the original asset.

* **Maturity**
    The specific future date when a `PT` becomes redeemable for its underlying asset at a 1:1 ratio, and when the corresponding `YT` stops accruing yield.

* **Flash Swaps**
    An advanced mechanism that allows for complex trades (like those involving `YT`) to be executed using the main `PT`/`SY` liquidity pool within a single, atomic transaction.

* **Price Impact (Slippage)**
    The effect a trade has on an asset's price within a liquidity pool. Larger trades relative to the pool's liquidity result in a worse execution price for the trader.

* **Zap In / Zap Out**
    A convenience function that automates the process of entering or exiting a liquidity position. It bundles multiple swaps and actions into a single user-facing transaction.
