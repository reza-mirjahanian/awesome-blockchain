# ðŸ“š **Pendle PT Glossary**

### **Pendle**

A DeFi protocol enabling **fixed yield** trading by separating a yield-bearing token into **Principal Token (PT)** and **Yield Token (YT)**.

---

### **Principal Token (PT)**

A token representing the *principal value* of a yield-bearing asset; redeemable for full value at **maturity**.

---

### **Yield Token (YT)**

Represents the **stream of yield** from a yield-bearing asset; expires when the maturity date is reached.

---

### **Fixed Yield**

A **guaranteed return** locked in at the time of PT purchase, independent of market fluctuations.

---

### **Fixed APY**

The **Annual Percentage Yield** youâ€™ll earn from PT if held until maturity; remains *unchanged* after purchase.

---

### **Underlying APY**

The **fluctuating yield** provided by the native yield-bearing asset (e.g., stETH); influenced by supply/demand.

---

### **stETH (Staked ETH)**

A token issued by **Lido** representing staked ETH that accrues staking rewards over time.

---

### **Maturity**

The **expiry date** at which PT can be redeemed for the full value of the underlying asset.

---

### **AMM Pool**

**Automated Market Maker** that enables trading of PT and YT with algorithmically adjusted prices and slippage.

---

### **Price Impact**

The **change in token price** caused by your trade within an AMM; higher for large or illiquid trades.

---

### **Slippage**

The **difference between expected and executed price** in a trade; often caused by price impact or market volatility.

---

### **Liquidity**

The total amount of tokens available in a pool for trading; low liquidity increases slippage and price impact.

---

### **Yield Volatility**

The **fluctuation of APY** in variable yield assets, often influenced by macro factors or protocol-specific events.

---

### **Redemption**

The act of **claiming the full value** of PT at maturity, converting it back into the underlying asset.

---

### **ETH Burn**

A deflationary mechanism where a portion of transaction fees is **permanently removed** from circulation, reducing ETH supply.

---

### **Yield Curve**

A visual or data-based representation comparing **Fixed APY vs Underlying APY** over time or across assets.

---

### **Dune Analytics**

A blockchain analytics platform for **on-chain data visualization**; used to monitor Pendle yield trends and behavior.

---

### **Capital Gains**

Profit made by **selling PT at a higher price** than purchase before maturity, without holding to earn fixed yield.

---

### **Staking**

The process of **locking tokens to earn rewards**, typically in Proof-of-Stake blockchains like Ethereum.

---

### **Pendle Trade Interface**

The **UI on Pendle Finance** where users can buy/sell PT and YT tokens, view APY stats, and manage positions.
