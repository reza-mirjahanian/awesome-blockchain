### **High Capital**
*A large amount of money or financial resources.*  
Often required for traditional investments like real estate or full-token ownership.

---

### **Yield-Bearing Asset**
*An asset that produces income over time.*  
Examples include rental properties, staking tokens (e.g., stETH), or bonds.

---

### **Principal**
*Refers to the underlying asset itself or the ownership rights to that asset.*  
Represents the **base value** of an asset, separate from the income it generates.  
In **yield tokenization**, principal is separated from yield to form two distinct components.

---

### **Yield**
*The income or return generated from holding an asset.*  
In Pendle, this is represented separately via **Yield Tokens (YT)**.

---

### **Predictable Returns**
*Returns that are known in advance, not subject to fluctuation.*  
**Principal Tokens (PTs)** offer predictable, **fixed yield**, unlike variable yield from YTs.

---

### **Maturity Date**
*The fixed date in the future when a token or contract comes due and is settled.*  
On this date:
- PT can be **redeemed** for the full value of the asset
- YT **expires** and stops earning yield

---

### **Maturity Value**
*The final value that a Principal Token (PT) is worth at maturity.*  
Usually equal to the **full value of the underlying asset**.  
For example:  
`Buy PT for 0.9 ETH â†’ Redeem for 1 ETH at maturity â†’ Maturity value = 1 ETH`

---

### **Fixed Yield**
*A known, guaranteed return earned by holding a PT until maturity.*

Formula:
```text
Fixed Yield = (Redemption Value - Purchase Price) / Purchase Price
````

Example:


(1 ETH - 0.9 ETH) / 0.9 ETH = 11.1% APY



Benefits:

* No exposure to yield volatility
* Ideal for risk-averse strategies

---

### **Pendle DEX**

*Pendle's decentralized exchange platform for trading PT and YT tokens.*
Allows users to:

* **Exit** their positions at any time before maturity
* **Buy** or **sell** PTs and YTs with liquidity

### **Token Comparison Table**

| **Component** | **Symbol** | **Benefit**            | **Risk Profile**              |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Principal** | `PT`       | Full asset at maturity | Fixed yield, no variable risk |
| **Yield**     | `YT`       | Ongoing income stream  | Variable yield, higher risk   |
