Organized in 2018, NUTS Finance is a blockchain development lab focused on creating the building blocks to enable financial applications on the blockchain.

  

We launched Tapio Protocol in 2021, a synthetic asset protocol for liquid staking tokens and raised over $4 million from industry leading institutional investors including: Polychain Capital, Hypersphere, Arrington and more.

  

Our latest DeFi protocol, Pike a native cross-chain money market was launched at the end of 2023 and we have raised over $6.4m from our own community and users.

Pike is a natively cross-chain lending market built with Wormhole and Circle on Base.

Tapio is a Ethereum-native liquidity aggregator that serves as the middle layer between LSTs and downstream DeFi applications.

Taiga is a synthetic asset standard for staking and crowdloan assets on Kusama.

ACoconut is a decentralized Bitcoin yield aggregator built ontop of the Ethereum network.
