## 1. What is NEAR Protocol?

NEAR Protocol is a **layer-1 blockchain** designed to be user-friendly, scalable, and developer-friendly. Think of it as a decentralized computing platform similar to Ethereum, but with several key improvements.

**Founded**: 2020  
**Type**: Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain  
**Focus**: Usability, scalability, and sustainable development  

### Quick Facts:
- Native token: NEAR
- Transaction finality: ~1-2 seconds
- Transaction fees: ~$0.01
- Carbon neutral blockchain
- Human-readable account names

---

## 2. Key Features & Benefits

### üöÄ **Sharding Technology (Nightshade)**
- Dynamically splits the network into multiple shards
- Each shard processes transactions in parallel
- Scales with demand (theoretical: 100,000+ TPS)

### üë§ **Human-Readable Accounts**
- Use names like `alice.near` instead of `0x7d8f9...`
- Makes crypto accessible to non-technical users

### üí∞ **Low & Predictable Fees**
- Transactions cost fractions of a cent
- Fees are burned, reducing token supply

### üîß **Developer-Friendly**
- Write smart contracts in Rust or JavaScript
- 30% of transaction fees go to contract developers
- Extensive documentation and tooling

### üåê **Interoperability**
- Rainbow Bridge connects NEAR to Ethereum
- Aurora: EVM-compatible layer for Ethereum apps

---

## 3. NEAR vs Other Blockchains

| Feature | NEAR | Ethereum | Solana |
|---------|------|----------|--------|
| **TPS** | 100,000+ (sharded) | ~15-30 | ~65,000 |
| **Finality** | 1-2 seconds | 2-3 minutes | <1 second |
| **Fees** | ~$0.01 | $5-50+ | ~$0.00025 |
| **Languages** | Rust, JavaScript | Solidity | Rust, C |
| **Account Model** | Human-readable | Hex addresses | Hex addresses |
| **Consensus** | PoS (Nightshade) | PoS | PoS + PoH |

---

## 4. Core Concepts

### **Sharding (Nightshade)**
NEAR's scaling solution that splits the blockchain into smaller pieces (shards) that process transactions in parallel. Unlike other sharding implementations, Nightshade maintains a single chain while distributing the computation.

### **Chunks**
Shards produce "chunks" - collections of transactions for their portion of the state. These chunks are combined to form blocks.

### **Validators**
- Secure the network by validating transactions
- Minimum stake: varies (check current requirements)
- Earn rewards for validation

### **Storage Staking**
- Accounts must maintain minimum balance for storage
- Prevents state bloat
- Refundable when data is deleted

---

## 5. NEAR Account System

### **Account Structure**

Top-level: alice.near
Sub-account: wallet.alice.near
Sub-sub-account: savings.wallet.alice.near

### **Account Types**
1. **Named Accounts**: Human-readable (e.g., `john.near`)
2. **Implicit Accounts**: 64-character hex (like Ethereum)

### **Access Keys**
- **Full Access Keys**: Complete account control
- **Function Call Keys**: Limited permissions for specific contracts
  - Can specify allowed methods
  - Can set allowance (gas limit)

### **Account Creation Cost**
- Named accounts: ~0.1 NEAR
- Implicit accounts: Free (just need first deposit)

---

## 6. Smart Contracts on NEAR

### **Supported Languages**
1. **Rust** (Recommended)
   - Better performance
   - Smaller contract size
   - More control

2. **JavaScript/TypeScript**
   - Easier for web developers
   - Quick prototyping
   - Slightly larger contracts

### **Contract Structure Example (Rust)**
rust
use near_sdk::{near_bindgen, env};

#[near_bindgen]
pub struct MyContract {
    owner: String,
    counter: u64,
}

#[near_bindgen]
impl MyContract {
    #[init]
    pub fn new(owner: String) -> Self {
        Self { owner, counter: 0 }
    }
    
    pub fn increment(&mut self) {
        self.counter += 1;
    }
}

### **Key Differences from Ethereum**
- No global state access
- Asynchronous cross-contract calls
- Built-in account abstraction
- Storage is explicitly paid for

---

## 7. NEAR Token Economics

### **Token Utility**
1. **Transaction fees**: Pay for computation and storage
2. **Storage staking**: Reserve storage space
3. **Validator staking**: Secure the network
4. **Governance**: Vote on protocol upgrades

### **Token Distribution**
- **Total Supply**: 1 billion NEAR at genesis
- **Annual Inflation**: ~5% (rewards to validators)
- **Fee Burning**: Transaction fees are burned

### **Staking Rewards**
- Annual rewards: ~10-12% (varies)
- No lock-up period for delegation
- Rewards distributed each epoch (~12 hours)
