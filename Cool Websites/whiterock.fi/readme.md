[WhiteRock](https://whiterock.fi/)Â is a new-generation decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that empowers users to buy and trade tokenized versions of real-world assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate using crypto assets. Built entirely on the blockchain, WhiteRock delivers unmatched transparency, security, and accessibility for all transactions.

By removing intermediaries, the platform enables permissionless trading, allowing users to participate in financial markets 24/7 without being restricted by traditional operating hours.

Unlike conventional stablecoins like USDT, USDX offers a unique benefit: it redistributes potential profits directly to users. With USDX, users see their balances grow daily, making it a secure and lucrative savings option within the WhiteRock ecosystem.


### Phase 1 (Live) Tokenized assets, $WHITE and USDX

WhitRock's trading infrastructure is currently operational, with bonds and equity are already live on-chain. Additionally, the $WHITE token has been unveiled, and users can now buy USDX, a native stablecoin, to gain on their USD.


### What is the underlying asset of the USDX stablecoin?

USDX is a stablecoin backed by short-term U.S. Treasury bills, which are government bonds issued by the U.S. government. As these bonds are guaranteed by the U.S. government, they are considered to be virtually risk-free and among the safest investments globally.


### What are tokenized stocks?

Tokenized stocks are digital tokens that represent ownership in an underlying asset, specifically stocks. These tokens allow fractional ownership and enable trading on blockchain platforms.
