# ZK EVMs: The Future of Ethereum Scaling

## Introduction

- **Guest**: David from Covalent (Growth and Customer Success)
- **Topic**: New research paper on ZK EVMs

## Why ZK EVMs are Generating Excitement

- Latest upgrade to zero-knowledge rollups
- Potential to significantly improve Ethereum's scalability
- Recent concrete steps towards implementation

### Key Milestones in Q1 2023

- March 3: Scroll launched Alpha testnet
- March 27: Polygon launched mainnet beta
- March 28: Consensys unveiled Linea (their ZK EVM)

## Current Landscape of Ethereum L2 Solutions

### Two Main Types of Layer 2s

1. **Optimistic Rollups**
   - Assume transactions are valid
   - Rely on actors to commit proofs during a one-week settlement period

2. **ZK Rollups**
   - Validate transactions using mathematically verifiable proofs
   - Settle on Ethereum mainnet immediately

### Advantages of ZK Rollups

- Instant settlements
- Better transaction finality
- Faster withdrawal times

### Current Adoption Landscape

- Optimistic rollups more widely adopted due to:
  - Easier implementation
  - EVM compatibility

- ZK Rollups initially had custom virtual machines, making adoption challenging

## ZK EVMs as the Ultimate Ethereum Scaling Solution

- Enables ZK Rollups to be EVM compatible and general-purpose
- Combines ZK technology benefits with Ethereum functionality
- Aligns with Vitalik's 2021 prediction of ZK Rollups outcompeting Optimistic Rollups

## Types of ZK EVMs

1. **Type 1**
   - Fully equivalent to Ethereum
   - Can reuse 100% of EVM infrastructure
   - Longest prover times

2. **Type 2**
   - Fully EVM equivalent
   - Trades full Ethereum equivalency for faster prover times
   - Easier development

3. **Type 3**
   - Further changes to improve proof generation
   - Compatible with some Ethereum dApps
   - May require rewriting for deployment

4. **Type 4**
   - Can only compile some EVM code
   - Limited compatibility with Ethereum dApps
   - Lowest costs and fastest prover times

## EVM Equivalence vs. EVM Compatibility

- **EVM Compatibility**: Enables blockchain compatibility with Ethereum
  - Developer experience may differ
  - May require rewriting of smart contracts

- **EVM Equivalence**: Ensures full bytecode compatibility with Ethereum
  - Simplifies migration of Ethereum-based apps
  - Enables easier interoperability with EVM dApps

## Leading Development Teams

1. **Polygon ZK EVM**
   - Initially Type 3, upgrading to Type 2
   - Launched mainnet beta on March 27, 2023
   - Over $5 million bridged to the network
   - Attracting popular DeFi protocols (Uniswap, Balancer, Hop)
   - Collaborating with Immutable for Web3 gaming

2. **Scroll**
   - Collaborating with Ethereum Foundation
   - $50 million fundraise at $1.8 billion valuation
   - Launched Alpha testnet on March 3, 2023
   - Over 3 million unique wallet addresses on testnet

3. **Linea (by Consensys)**
   - In development since 2019
   - Introduced public testnet on March 28, 2023
   - Over 600k unique wallet addresses on Gorilli testnet
   - Leveraging Consensys' reputation for partnerships

## Impact on Ethereum Landscape

- ZK EVMs expected to outcompete Optimistic Rollups
- Type 2 ZK EVMs offer significant UX enhancements for developers
- Provides a new frontier for users to explore
