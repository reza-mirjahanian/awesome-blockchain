**StarGate is built on top of LayerZero protocol** and is a liquidity network for cross-chain transfer for assets. It leverages an oracle and relayer for cross-chain security for the protocol. Note that StarGate UI also supports omnichain tokens built directly on top of LayerZero protocol, e.g. JOE.

## Stargate is a fully composable liquidity  
transport protocol that lives at the  
heart of Omnichain DeFi

With Stargate, users & dApps can transfer native assets cross-chain while accessing  
the protocolâ€™s unified liquidity pools with instant guaranteed finality. The universe is  
infinite with Stargate.
