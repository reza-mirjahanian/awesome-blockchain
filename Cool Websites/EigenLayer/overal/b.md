1\. What is cryptographic security in the context of blockchain technology?

- Answer: Cryptographic security refers to the protection provided by cryptographic primitives like digital signatures, hash functions, and zero-knowledge proofs. These ensure that blockchain transactions are authentic and tamper-proof. For instance, when you send Bitcoin or swap tokens on Ethereum, you sign a message with your private key using a scheme like ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). This process is computationally cheap—costing less than a cent in electricity—but breaking it requires an attacker to expend immense resources, such as billions of dollars and thousands of years of computing power, creating a strong defender advantage.
    

2\. How does cryptoeconomic security differ from cryptographic security?

- Answer: Cryptoeconomic security relies on economic incentives rather than pure mathematics to secure a blockchain. While cryptographic security protects specific actions (e.g., signing transactions), cryptoeconomic security ensures broader system integrity, like consistent block production and resistance to chain reorganizations. It uses mechanisms like proof of work (PoW) or proof of stake (PoS) to align participants’ financial interests with the network’s stability, addressing issues that cryptography alone cannot solve due to the free will of independent agents.
    

3\. Why is cryptoeconomic security necessary in blockchain systems?

- Answer: Cryptoeconomic security is essential because cryptography alone cannot guarantee the behavior of independent participants in a decentralized system. For example, it can’t mathematically ensure that a block producer will create blocks or that the chain won’t be arbitrarily altered. By introducing economic incentives—such as rewards for honest behavior and penalties (e.g., slashing) for dishonesty—cryptoeconomics aligns participants’ actions with the network’s needs, making blockchain systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum viable.
    

4\. What is the significance of asymmetry in cryptographic security?

- Answer: The asymmetry in cryptographic security means the effort to secure a transaction (e.g., creating a signature for less than a cent) is vastly lower than the effort to break it (e.g., forging a signature, costing billions). This defender advantage makes cryptographic solutions highly efficient for problems they can solve, like transaction authenticity, and is why they’re preferred when applicable.
    

5\. How does the amount of capital in a cryptoeconomic system affect its security?

- Answer: The more capital invested in a cryptoeconomic system, the stronger its security. In Bitcoin’s PoW, a large mining industry with significant capital investment (e.g., hardware and energy costs) raises the cost for an attacker to achieve majority hash power. Similarly, in Ethereum’s PoS, attackers need to acquire substantial ETH to control the stake, risking loss through slashing. Thus, higher capital increases the economic barrier to attacks.
    

6\. What are some problems that cryptography alone cannot solve in blockchain systems?

- Answer: Cryptography cannot address subjective or behavioral issues, such as:
    
    - Ensuring blocks are produced reliably in the future.
        
    - Preventing arbitrary chain reorganizations.
        
    - Prioritizing high-value transactions in blocks. These depend on the actions of independent agents, requiring economic incentives to influence behavior.
        

7\. How does proof of work contribute to cryptoeconomic security?

- Answer: In PoW, miners invest capital in hardware (e.g., ASICs) and energy to solve computational puzzles, securing the network by adding blocks. This capital investment creates a high barrier for attackers, who must outspend honest miners to gain majority hash power and attempt a 51% attack. The economic cost and potential loss of rewards deter such attacks, enhancing security.
    

8\. What is the role of slashing in proof of stake systems?

- Answer: Slashing in PoS systems penalizes validators who act dishonestly (e.g., signing conflicting blocks) by confiscating part or all of their staked capital. This economic disincentive ensures validators follow protocol rules, as the risk of losing valuable ETH outweighs potential gains from misbehavior, bolstering network security.

Section 2: Paradigms of Cryptoeconomic Capital Efficiency

9\. What is meant by 'capital efficiency' in the context of blockchain security?

- Answer: Capital efficiency measures how effectively the capital invested in securing a blockchain is utilized. A system is more capital-efficient if it secures more functionality (e.g., transactions, smart contracts) or throughput with the same amount of capital. The four paradigms—Bitcoin, Ethereum, rollups, and EigenLayer—represent progressive improvements in this efficiency.
    

10\. Describe the first paradigm of cryptoeconomic capital efficiency as exemplified by Bitcoin.

- Answer: Bitcoin, the first paradigm, uses significant capital (via mining) to secure a simple ledger for sending and receiving BTC at 5-7 transactions per second (TPS). This is relatively inefficient because the large capital investment supports only basic functionality, with limited scalability or programmability.
    

11\. Why was there a desire for more coins and functionality beyond Bitcoin?

- Answer: Users and developers sought diverse assets (e.g., tokens) and applications (e.g., decentralized finance, NFTs) that Bitcoin’s simple ledger couldn’t support. This led to attempts like creating new coins (Litecoin, Dogecoin) or extending Bitcoin’s functionality (colored coins, Mastercoin) to meet these demands.
    

12\. How did Ethereum improve upon Bitcoin in terms of capital efficiency?

- Answer: Ethereum, the second paradigm, introduced a Turing-complete programming language, enabling smart contracts that support infinite functionalities (e.g., DeFi, NFTs). The same capital securing Ethereum’s network now supports a vastly expanded range of applications, making it far more efficient than Bitcoin’s limited ledger.
    

13\. What is the role of rollups in enhancing capital efficiency?

- Answer: Rollups, the third paradigm, are layer 2 solutions that process transactions off-chain and batch them onto Ethereum, increasing throughput to hundreds or thousands of TPS. They inherit Ethereum’s security, allowing the same staked capital to secure multiple parallel “Ethereums,” significantly boosting efficiency.
    

14\. Explain how EigenLayer represents the fourth paradigm in cryptoeconomic capital efficiency.

- Answer: EigenLayer, the fourth paradigm, reuses Ethereum’s staked capital to secure external systems (AVSs) via restaking. Stakers opt into securing services like data availability or sequencers, earning extra rewards. This extends the utility of capital beyond Ethereum and its rollups, potentially securing an unlimited range of systems.
    

15\. What is merged mining, and what are its limitations?

- Answer: Merged mining lets miners secure multiple blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin and Namecoin) simultaneously without splitting hash power. However, its limitations include misaligned incentives—miners may prioritize the primary chain—potentially weakening the security of the secondary chain compared to dedicated mining.
    

16\. How did colored coins attempt to extend Bitcoin’s functionality?

- Answer: Colored coins added metadata to specific Bitcoin fractions (satoshis), marking them to represent other assets (e.g., cars, NFTs). Sending these “colored” satoshis on Bitcoin’s ledger transferred ownership of the associated assets, providing a basic extension of functionality.
    

17\. What was the innovation of Mastercoin?

- Answer: Mastercoin embedded additional transaction types into Bitcoin transactions, enabling separate currencies or assets (e.g., Proto Pepe) to be created and transferred. This expanded Bitcoin’s utility beyond simple transfers, though it required continual upgrades for new features.
    

18\. Why is a Turing-complete programming language significant for blockchain platforms?

- Answer: A Turing-complete language can compute any function, allowing developers to write smart contracts for any imaginable task (e.g., DeFi, games). This eliminates the need for protocol upgrades per use case, as seen with Mastercoin, unlocking infinite possibilities and enhancing capital efficiency.
    

19\. What was the key realization that led to the creation of Ethereum?

- Answer: Vitalik Buterin realized that instead of adding specific transaction types for each new function (as in Mastercoin), a general-purpose, Turing-complete language could be embedded into the blockchain. This allowed developers to program any application, leading to Ethereum’s creation.
    

20\. How do rollups achieve higher transaction throughput?

- Answer: Rollups process transactions off-chain, batch them into a single transaction, and post the result to the main chain (Ethereum). This reduces on-chain load, enabling hundreds or thousands of TPS while leveraging the main chain’s security, vastly improving throughput over Ethereum’s 15-20 TPS.
    

21\. What does it mean for a programming language to be Turing-complete?

- Answer: A Turing-complete language can perform any computation a Turing machine can, given sufficient resources. In blockchain, this means smart contracts can execute any logic or program, limited only by gas costs and computation power, not by the protocol’s design.
    

22\. Why can’t Ethereum simply increase its block size to achieve higher throughput?

- Answer: Larger blocks increase resource demands (e.g., storage, bandwidth), risking centralization as fewer nodes can participate. It also slows block propagation, raising security risks like forks. Rollups address this by scaling off-chain while preserving decentralization.
    

23\. What is the concept of 'inheriting security' in the context of rollups?

- Answer: Rollups inherit Ethereum’s security because their state transitions are verified and enforced by Ethereum’s consensus. Transactions are processed off-chain, but the main chain ensures correctness via fraud proofs (optimistic rollups) or validity proofs (zk-rollups).
    

---

Section 3: EigenLayer Specifics

24\. What is restaking in the context of EigenLayer?

- Answer: Restaking allows Ethereum stakers to reuse their staked ETH to secure additional systems (AVSs) beyond Ethereum. By opting into EigenLayer, stakers run software for these services, risking slashing of their ETH if they misbehave, while earning extra rewards.
    

25\. How does EigenLayer integrate with Ethereum’s staking mechanism?

- Answer: EigenLayer uses smart contracts (EigenPods) as withdrawal addresses for staked ETH. Stakers deposit ETH into Ethereum’s staking contract, setting the withdrawal to an EigenPod. This contract manages restaking and enforces slashing for AVS misbehavior upon exit.
    

26\. What are AVSs in EigenLayer?

- Answer: AVSs (Actively Validated Services) are external systems secured by restaked ETH through EigenLayer. Examples include:
    
    - Data availability services.
        
    - Sequencers for rollups.
        
    - Oracles, bridges, and zero-knowledge proof systems. These enhance the Ethereum ecosystem or serve independent purposes.
        

27\. What are the potential benefits of using EigenLayer for stakers?

- Answer: Stakers can earn additional rewards from AVSs, potentially increasing returns from Ethereum’s 2-3% to 20% or more, depending on AVS incentives (e.g., token payments). This makes staking more lucrative, leveraging the same capital for multiple income streams.
    

28\. What challenges or risks does EigenLayer introduce?

- Answer: EigenLayer adds complexity and risks, such as:
    
    - Incentive Misalignment: AVS rewards complicate Ethereum’s staking economics.
        
    - Slashing Risks: Stakers face penalties across multiple systems.
        
    - Systemic Risk: Failures in one AVS could impact others if capital is over-leveraged. Balancing these requires careful design.
        

29\. What is an EigenPod in EigenLayer?

- Answer: An EigenPod is a smart contract deployed by a staker as their ETH withdrawal address. It manages restaking by registering AVSs and recording slashing events. When the staker exits, it distributes only the remaining ETH after slashing.
    

30\. How does the slashing mechanism work in EigenLayer?

- Answer: If a staker misbehaves in an AVS (e.g., censoring transactions), the AVS sends a slashing request with proof to the EigenPod. The EigenPod logs the penalty (e.g., -1 ETH). Upon exiting Ethereum staking, the staker receives only the unslashed ETH (e.g., 31 of 32 ETH).
    

31\. What is the role of the withdrawal address in EigenLayer’s restaking mechanism?

- Answer: The withdrawal address is set to the EigenPod contract when staking ETH. This locks the staker into EigenLayer’s slashing rules, ensuring that upon exit, the contract can withhold slashed ETH, enforcing accountability for AVS behavior.
    

32\. How does EigenLayer enable the securing of systems outside of Ethereum?

- Answer: EigenLayer reuses Ethereum’s staked ETH to secure external AVSs by allowing stakers to opt into running their software. These systems define objective slashing conditions, and misbehavior triggers slashing via the EigenPod, extending security beyond Ethereum.
    

33\. What are some examples of AVSs that can be secured through EigenLayer?

- Answer: Examples include:
    
    - Data Availability Services: Cheap storage for rollup data.
        
    - Sequencers: Transaction ordering for rollups.
        
    - Oracles: External data feeds.
        
    - Bridges: Cross-chain interoperability.
        
    - ZK Systems: Zero-knowledge proof generation.
        

34\. How might EigenLayer affect the incentives for Ethereum stakers?

- Answer: EigenLayer offers stakers extra rewards from AVSs, potentially raising total returns significantly. However, it increases risk exposure (slashing) and complicates Ethereum’s issuance design, as external payments influence staking economics outside its control.
    

35\. What is the potential impact of EigenLayer on the Ethereum ecosystem?

- Answer: EigenLayer could:
    
    - Enhance Functionality: Secure auxiliary services like sequencers and data availability.
        
    - Boost Interoperability: Support bridges and external systems.
        
    - Increase Complexity: Introduce new risks and incentive challenges. It may strengthen Ethereum’s ecosystem but requires managing systemic risks.
        

36\. Why is objectivity important for tasks secured through EigenLayer?

- Answer: Objectivity ensures slashing conditions are clear and provable (e.g., via cryptographic evidence), enabling automated enforcement in a decentralized system. Subjective tasks requiring human judgment are impractical without additional mechanisms.
    

37\. What is the EigenLayer token, and how does it relate to intersubjective work?

- Answer: The EigenLayer token (e.g., EIGEN) aims to handle intersubjective tasks—those not purely objective—where slashing consensus isn’t straightforward. It may facilitate governance or dispute resolution for subjective work, expanding EigenLayer’s scope beyond objective AVSs.
    

38\. Can stakers participate in multiple AVSs simultaneously through EigenLayer?

- Answer: Yes, stakers can opt into multiple AVSs, running their software concurrently and earning rewards from each. However, this multiplies slashing risks, as misbehavior in any AVS could reduce their total staked ETH.
    

---

Section 4: Additional Concepts and Comparisons

39\. How does EigenLayer address the need for securing auxiliary functions in the rollup ecosystem?

- Answer: EigenLayer secures rollup auxiliary functions (e.g., sequencers, data availability) by reusing Ethereum’s staked ETH. Instead of each function bootstrapping its own security, stakers opt into AVSs, aligning incentives via rewards and slashing, enhancing ecosystem efficiency.
    

40\. What is the role of sequencers in rollups?

- Answer: Sequencers order and batch transactions in rollups before submitting them to the main chain. They improve efficiency but can censor transactions, necessitating cryptoeconomic security (e.g., via EigenLayer) to align their behavior with user interests.
    

41\. Why is data availability important for rollups?

- Answer: Data availability ensures all transaction data is accessible to reconstruct the rollup’s state. This is vital for security, as users or validators can verify state transitions. EigenLayer can secure cheap, external data availability systems for cost efficiency.
    

42\. How does EigenLayer compare to other restaking or liquid staking solutions?

- Answer: Unlike liquid staking (e.g., Lido), which focuses on liquidity for staked ETH, EigenLayer enables stakers to secure multiple external systems simultaneously. It’s a generalized framework for capital reuse, not just liquidity or single-system staking.
    

43\. What are the potential risks of over-leveraging staked capital through EigenLayer?

- Answer: Over-leveraging risks include:
    
    - Cascading Failures: A fault in one AVS could affect others sharing the same capital.
        
    - Increased Complexity: Managing multiple slashing conditions is challenging.
        
    - Centralization: High rewards might concentrate staking power. Careful AVS design mitigates these.
        

44\. How does EigenLayer ensure that AVSs are secure and trustworthy?

- Answer: EigenLayer relies on:
    
    - Economic Incentives: Stakers risk slashing, encouraging honesty.
        
    - Objective Slashing: AVSs must define clear, provable conditions.
        
    - Staker Opt-In: Stakers choose trusted AVSs, fostering market-driven reliability.
        

45\. How does EigenLayer handle the complexity of managing multiple slashing conditions?

- Answer: Each AVS defines its slashing rules, sending requests to the EigenPod with proof of misbehavior. The EigenPod aggregates these, deducting the total slashed amount when the staker exits, simplifying enforcement across multiple systems.
    

46\. What is the difference between optimistic rollups and zk-rollups?

- Answer:
    
    - Optimistic Rollups: Assume transactions are valid, using fraud proofs to challenge errors, offering lower computation costs but slower finality.
        
    - Zk-Rollups: Use zero-knowledge proofs to validate transactions, ensuring immediate correctness but requiring more computation upfront. EigenLayer can secure auxiliary functions for both.
        

47\. How might EigenLayer influence the design of future blockchain protocols?

- Answer: Future protocols might integrate EigenLayer-like restaking to leverage existing security (e.g., Ethereum’s) rather than building standalone validator sets, fostering a shared-security ecosystem and reducing bootstrap costs.
    

48\. What is the significance of EigenLayer for blockchain scalability and interoperability?

- Answer: EigenLayer enhances scalability by securing rollup components (e.g., sequencers) and interoperability by supporting bridges and oracles, all with reused capital. This creates a more scalable, interconnected blockchain landscape.
    

49\. How does Bitcoin’s capital efficiency compare to Ethereum’s?

- Answer: Bitcoin’s capital secures a basic ledger (5-7 TPS), making it less efficient. Ethereum’s capital supports a Turing-complete platform with smart contracts, vastly increasing functionality per unit of capital, especially with rollups.
    

50\. What limitations does EigenLayer face in securing subjective tasks?

- Answer: EigenLayer requires objective slashing conditions for automation, limiting it to tasks with provable misbehavior. Subjective tasks (e.g., human judgment calls) need intersubjective mechanisms, potentially addressed by the EigenLayer token.
    

51\. How does EigenLayer’s approach differ from creating separate blockchains like Litecoin?

- Answer: Separate blockchains require bootstrapping new security (e.g., mining), splitting capital and reducing efficiency. EigenLayer reuses Ethereum’s existing capital, avoiding this fragmentation and enhancing overall security utilization.
    

52\. Why might Ethereum’s staking rewards be affected by EigenLayer?

- Answer: AVS rewards could outpace Ethereum’s native rewards, drawing stakers to EigenLayer and pressuring Ethereum to adjust issuance. This external influence complicates Ethereum’s economic model, requiring careful calibration.

## **Cryptographic vs. Cryptoeconomic Security**

### **1. What is cryptographic security in blockchain?**
**Answer:**  
Cryptographic security relies on mathematical primitives like:
- **Digital signatures** (e.g., ECDSA for Bitcoin/Ethereum).
- **Hash functions** (e.g., SHA-256).
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** (e.g., zk-SNARKs).  
These tools ensure data integrity, authentication, and confidentiality. For example, signing a transaction with a private key costs negligible energy (<$0.01) but requires infeasible computational resources to forge.

---

### **2. How does cryptoeconomic security differ from cryptographic security?**
**Answer:**  
- **Cryptoeconomic security** combines cryptography with economic incentives to secure subjective behaviors (e.g., block production, chain reorganization).  
- **Example:** Proof of Work (PoW) in Bitcoin incentivizes miners to act honestly by rewarding block creation and penalizing attacks via sunk hardware/electricity costs.

---

### **3. Why does cryptographic security offer a "defender advantage"?**

- Secures **Actively Validated Services (AVS)** like EigenDA, Hyperlane.

---

### **11. How does slashing work in EigenLayer?**
**Answer:**  
- Validators set their withdrawal address to an **EigenPod** (smart contract).
- AVSs submit **cryptographic proofs** of validator misconduct to the pod.
- The pod **slashes ETH** (reducing withdrawable amounts) if violations occur.

---

### **12. What are AVSs, and how do they interact with EigenLayer?**
**Answer:**  
**Actively Validated Services (AVS)** are external systems (e.g., data availability layers) that:
- Define **slashing conditions** (e.g., data withholding).
- Reward validators for honest participation.  
Validators opt into AVSs, increasing capital utility.

---

## **Comparative Analysis**

### **13. Compare Bitcoin and Ethereum in capital efficiency.**
**Answer:**

Currently, EigenLayer supports **objective faults** (provable via cryptography). The **AG token** (future work) aims to address **intersubjective faults** (e.g., social consensus on chain splits).

---

### **18. What is merged mining, and why did it fail to scale?**
**Answer:**  
Merged mining (e.g., Namecoin) lets miners secure multiple chains with one PoW. **Limitations**:
- Misaligned incentives (miners prioritize dominant chains).
- Limited adoption due to low economic value for auxiliary chains.

---

## **Future Implications**

### **19. How could EigenLayer impact decentralized oracles?**
**Answer:**  
Oracles (e.g., Chainlink) could use EigenLayer to:

**Answer:**  
ZK proofs enable:
- **Private slashing** (proving violations without revealing data).
- **Efficient verification** of AVS compliance (reducing on-chain costs).

---

## **Historical Context**

### **25. How did colored coins inspire Ethereum?**
**Answer:**  
Colored coins added metadata to Bitcoin transactions to represent assets (e.g., NFTs). Limitations in programmability led Vitalik to propose **smart contracts**, culminating in Ethereum.

---

### **26. Why did Mastercoin fail to scale functionality?**
**Answer:**  
Mastercoin required **protocol upgrades** for new transaction types. Ethereum’s Turing-complete VM eliminated this by letting developers program arbitrary logic.

---

## **Economic Incentives**

### **27. How do AVSs incentivize validators to participate?**
**Answer:**  
AVSs issue **native tokens** or fees to validators, offering **additional yield** (e.g., 5–10% APR) atop Ethereum staking rewards (~3–5%).

---

### **28. What prevents validators from joining too many AVSs?**
**Answer:**  
- **Risk management**: Validators balance rewards against slashing risks.
- **Market forces**: Overloaded validators may underperform, reducing rewards.

---

## **Criticisms and Challenges**

### **29. Does EigenLayer centralize Ethereum’s security?**

**Answer:**  
By providing **decentralized, cryptoeconomically secured** alternatives for:
- Data storage (vs. AWS S3).
- Compute (vs. Lambda).
- Oracles (vs. centralized APIs).

---

### **36. Could EigenLayer reduce the need for new L1 blockchains?**
**Answer:**  
Yes: Projects can launch as AVSs on EigenLayer instead of bootstrapping L1s, leveraging Ethereum’s security and reducing fragmentation.

---

## **Validators and Economics**

### **37. How does restaking affect validator profitability?**
**Answer:**  
- **Upside**: Higher yields from multiple AVSs.
- **Downside**: Slashing risks and increased operational complexity.  
Validators must optimize their AVS portfolio.

---

### **38. What is the opportunity cost of restaking?**
**Answer:**  
Capital locked in EigenLayer cannot be used elsewhere (e.g., DeFi lending). Validators weigh restaking rewards against alternative yields.

---

## **EigenLayer’s Future**

### **39. What is the role of the AG token in EigenLayer?**
**Answer:**  
The **AG token** (proposed) would:
- Govern intersubjective slashing (e.g., social consensus).
- Incentivize participation in non-objective tasks (e.g., dispute resolution).

---

### **40. How could EigenLayer evolve to support DAOs?**

- Coordinate cross-chain actions via restaked capital.

---

## **Security Considerations**

### **41. How is AVS security quantified in EigenLayer?**
**Answer:**  
- **Total Value Secured (TVS)**: Sum of restaked ETH allocated to the AVS.
- **Attack cost**: TVS * slashing penalty % (e.g., 10% slash = attacker loses 10% of TVS).

---

### **42. Can EigenLayer validators influence multiple AVSs collusively?**
**Answer:**  
Possible, but **sybil-resistant identity** (e.g., Ethereum validator keys) and **overlapping slashing** deter collusion. Attacks would require controlling >33% of restaked ETH.

## **User Perspective**

### **43. How do end-users benefit from EigenLayer?**
**Answer:**  
- **Cheaper services**: AVSs share Ethereum’s security, reducing costs.
- **Faster innovation**: New projects launch without bootstrapping validators.
- **Interoperability**: Cross-AVS composability (e.g., unified liquidity).

---

### **44. What are the risks for users of AVSs?**
**Answer:**  
- **AVS failure**: Bugs or slashing could disrupt services.
- **Centralization**: Dominant AVSs may emerge, reducing decentralization.

---

## **Regulatory and Compliance**

### **45. How might regulators view EigenLayer?**
**Answer:**  
- **Scrutiny**: Restaking could be classified as a security (profit-sharing model).
- **Compliance**: AVSs may need KYC/AML integration for regulated assets.

---

### **46. Could EigenLayer enable compliant privacy solutions?**
**Answer:**  
Yes: ZK-proof-based AVSs could offer **auditable privacy** (e.g., tax-compliant anonymous transactions).

---

## **Technical Limitations**

### **47. What are the computational limits of EigenLayer?**
**Answer:**  
- **Node requirements**: Validators must run AVS-specific software, increasing hardware demands.
- **Throughput**: Ethereum’s L1 limits how many slashing proofs can be processed.

---

### **48. How does EigenLayer handle conflicting slashing events?**
**Answer:**  
- **Priority rules**: Pods process slashing in FIFO order.
- **Dispute periods**: Validators can challenge incorrect slashing via on-chain proofs.

---

## **Adoption Challenges**

### **49. What barriers exist to EigenLayer adoption?**
**Answer:**  
- **Complexity**: Restaking requires technical expertise.
- **Liquidity lockup**: ETH locked in EigenLayer is illiquid.
- **Regulatory uncertainty**: Potential legal risks for AVSs.

---

### **50. How could EigenLayer foster cross-chain interoperability?**
**Answer:**  
- **Shared security**: Bridges secured by restaked ETH (e.g., Hyperlane).
- **Unified slashing**: Validators penalized for cross-chain double-signing.  
This reduces the "trusted third-party" risk in cross-chain transactions.
