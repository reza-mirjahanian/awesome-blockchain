## **1. Background & Context**

### **Q1: What problem does Map Boost Plus+ aim to solve in Ethereum’s MEV ecosystem?**  
**A:** Map Boost Plus+ addresses centralization risks in Ethereum’s Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) framework. Over 90% of validators sell their transaction inclusion power to centralized builders, concentrating power in a few entities. This design aims to **decentralize block production** by allowing proposers to retain partial transaction inclusion power while earning MEV profits.

---

### **Q2: Why is the current reliance on centralized builders problematic?**  
**A:** Centralized builders create:  
- **Censorship risks** (e.g., blocking specific transactions).  
- **Single points of failure** (e.g., collusion or manipulation).  
- **Reduced liveness** if builders withhold blocks.  

---

## **2. Trust Assumptions in Current MEV Systems**

### **Q3: What are the three main trust assumptions between builders and relays?**  
**A:**  
1. **Non-publication**: Relays keep blocks private until auction completion.  
2. **No tampering**: Relays do not alter blocks or steal MEV.  
3. **Auction integrity**: Relays select the highest valid bid.  

---

### **Q4: How do trust assumptions differ between builders and proposers?**  
**A:**  
- **Builders** require **strong trust** in relays (e.g., non-tampering).  
- **Proposers** only need **weak trust** (e.g., block validity and data availability).  

---

### **Q5: What is a "block withholding attack"?**  
**A:** A relay intentionally delays or fails to broadcast a block, causing proposers to lose rewards or face slashing for inactivity.  

---

## **3. Map Boost Plus Design**

### **Q6: How does Map Boost Plus differ from traditional MEV-Boost?**  
**A:**  
- **Partial block auctions**: Proposers sell a portion of the block (e.g., top 50%) to builders but retain control over the remaining space.  
- **Cryptoeconomic slashing**: Proposers face penalties for deviating from commitments (e.g., altering partial blocks).  

---

### **Q7: What is a "partial block" in Map Boost Plus?**  
**A:** A block segment (e.g., top 50%) built by a builder, containing MEV-rich transactions. The proposer fills the rest with non-MEV transactions.  

---

### **Q8: How does Map Boost Plus enhance censorship resistance?**  
**A:** By allowing proposers to include transactions in their reserved block space, even if builders/relays attempt censorship.  

---

### **Q9: What role do Merkle proofs play in Map Boost Plus?**  
**A:** They enable **fraud proofs** to verify proposer compliance:  
1. **Inclusion proof**: Validates the partial block’s transactions.  
2. **Exclusion proof**: Detects unauthorized changes by proposers.  

---

## **4. Cryptoeconomic Incentives & Slashing**

### **Q10: How are proposers penalized for tampering with partial blocks?**  
**A:**  
- Proposers bond ETH in a **slashing contract**.  
- If fraud proofs show deviation (e.g., reordering transactions), their stake is slashed, with rewards distributed to builders/challengers.  

---

### **Q11: What is an "optimistic fraud proof"?**  
**A:** A mechanism where challenges are only processed if a dispute arises, reducing on-chain computation. Proposers are assumed honest unless proven otherwise.  

---

### **Q12: Why is a time-stamped DA (Data Availability) certificate critical?**  
**A:** It ensures the partial block is retrievable during the challenge period, preventing proposers from claiming data unavailability.  

---

## **5. Decentralized Map Boost Plus+**

### **Q13: How does Map Boost Plus+ decentralize relays?**  
**A:** By replacing centralized relays with:  
- **Programmable DA layers**: Decentralized networks (e.g., EigenDA) store partial blocks.  
- **Builder collateral**: Builders bond ETH to guarantee block validity.  

---

### **Q14: What is a "custom data release policy"?**  
**A:** A rule enforced by the DA layer (e.g., “release data only after proposer signature”), ensuring partial blocks are revealed only after validation.  

---

### **Q15: How do builders and proposers interact in Map Boost Plus+?**  
**A:**  
1. Builder submits a partial block + DA certificate.  
2. Proposer signs a commitment to include it.  
3. DA layer releases the block post-signature.  
4. Proposer constructs the full block.  

---

## **6. Tradeoffs & Challenges**

### **Q16: What are the tradeoffs of partial block auctions?**  
**A:**  
- **Pros**: Reduced centralization, improved censorship resistance.  
- **Cons**: Lower MEV revenue for proposers, increased complexity.  

---

### **Q17: Why might builders avoid partial blocks?**  
**A:** High-value MEV opportunities (e.g., arbitrage) require atomicity, which partial blocks may disrupt.  

---

### **Q18: How does Map Boost Plus+ handle conflicting blocks?**  
**A:** A **preference selector** lets proposers prioritize MEV profit vs. censorship resistance when choosing between partial/full blocks.  

---

## **7. Implementation Details**

### **Q19: What is a "blinded execution payload"?**  
**A:** A block header (without transaction details) signed by proposers to commit to a block without viewing its contents.  

---

### **Q20: How are withdrawal credentials used in slashing?**  
**A:** Proposers set withdrawal addresses to slashing contracts, enabling automatic penalties for misbehavior.  

---

### **Q21: What is the role of ion layer in Map Boost Plus?**  
**A:** It enforces slashing conditions via on-chain fraud proofs and manages cryptoeconomic penalties.  

---

## **8. Future Implications**

### **Q22: How might Map Boost Plus+ impact Ethereum’s validator set?**  
**A:** It could attract more decentralized participants by reducing reliance on centralized builders.  

---

### **Q23: Can Map Boost Plus+ coexist with traditional MEV-Boost?**  
**A:** Yes. Proposers can choose between full/partial blocks via the preference selector.  

---

### **Q24: What are the risks of optimistic fraud proofs?**  
**A:** Delayed challenges could allow temporary MEV extraction before slashing occurs.  

---

## **9. Technical Components**

### **Q25: How is the "top of block" defined in partial blocks?**  
**A:** The segment containing MEV-rich transactions (e.g., arbitrage, liquidations), typically prioritized for maximum profit.  

---

### **Q26: What is a "bid accuracy" check?**  
**A:** Validating that the builder’s bid matches the MEV value in the partial block.  

---

### **Q27: How does the relay ensure block validity?**  
**A:** By verifying:  
- **Execution correctness**: Transactions execute without errors.  
- **Bid alignment**: MEV value matches the bid.  

---

## **10. Security Considerations**

### **Q28: How does Map Boost Plus+ mitigate block withholding attacks?**  
**A:** DA layers ensure data availability, while slashing penalizes relays/builders for non-publication.  

---

### **Q29: What happens if a DA layer fails to store a partial block?**  
**A:** The proposer cannot construct a valid full block, leading to missed rewards. Builders may also be slashed for invalid DA certificates.  

---

### **Q30: How is proposer signature misuse prevented?**  
**A:** Signatures are cryptographically tied to specific block headers, making reuse detectable.  

---

**A:** To cover potential slashing (e.g., for invalid blocks) while ensuring proposers are compensated.  

---

### **Q34: How are MEV profits distributed in partial blocks?**  
**A:** Builders pay proposers for the top segment, while proposers earn standard rewards from their reserved space.  

---

### **Q35: What is the "bonding curve" for builder collateral?**

**A:** They can fill it with low-fee transactions or leave it blank, but earn no additional MEV.  

---

### **Q38: Can a malicious proposer spam the network with invalid partial blocks?**

---

### **Q42: Could partial blocks reduce block space efficiency?**

---

## **16. Future Directions**

---

### **Q48: What educational resources are needed for adoption?**  
**A:** Documentation on partial block construction, slashing risks, and DA layer interactions.  

---

## **19. Ethical Considerations**

### **Q49: Does Map Boost Plus+ favor certain types of MEV?**  
**A:** It prioritizes “vanilla” MEV (e.g., arbitrage) over complex strategies (e.g., sandwich attacks), which may require full blocks.  

---

### **Q50: How does Map Boost Plus+ address miner extractable value (MEV) inequality?**  
**A:** By democratizing access to MEV opportunities, it reduces the advantage of centralized players.
