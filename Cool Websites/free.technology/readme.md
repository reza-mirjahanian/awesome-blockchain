### NimBus
A lightweight Ethereum client implementation designed to reduce hardware requirements for solo stakers and increase efficiency for institutional staking service operators. Nimbus’ mission is to make staking accessible, thus promoting maximum network decentralisation. The Nimbus consensus client is in production, and an execution client is in development. By offering lightweight implementations for both consensus and execution layers, Nimbus simplifies operating an Ethereum node for hobbyists and institutional stakers alike.


### Keycard 
A discreet, convenient, affordable hardware security solution for crypto assets. Taking the form of a credit card, Keycard offers comparable crypto security at a fraction of the cost of others in the hardware wallet niche. Keycard is in production, and the team is working on a full hardware wallet, which will be entirely open-source and compatible with existing Keycards while offering a familiar user experience.

### Status
A blockchain-based super app that combines private messaging, a wallet, a DApp browser, and tools for web3 community management. Status aims to be a truly decentralised communication tool and, since its founding in 2017, has been progressively removing reliance on centralised infrastructure. The application leverages Waku and other technologies developed under the IFT umbrella.


### Nomos 
A sovereign, modular, zk-encrypted network of blockchains. The trustless agreements layer of the Logos stack. The forthcoming Nomos network will provide a common infrastructure layer upon which communities and aspiring network states can build social, governance, and financial services that uphold their community members’ fundamental rights and values.

### Waku

A family of generalised P2P communications protocols. The messaging layer of the Logos stack. Waku is private, censorship resistant, modular, and scalable by design. This combination of features makes Waku suitable to run in a wide range of environments, including phones and browsers, while upholding its users’ rights to private communications.
