Ever wondered how a single MEV bot crypto trader can make a whopping $1M per day? Meet Jaredfromsubway, the mastermind behind one of the most ruthless MEV bots in the market!

What's an MEV bot, you ask? MEV (Miner Extractable Value) bots have been around for a while, but they've gained new attention thanks to our friend Jared. These bots detect high slippage transactions on zero tax coins, making them prime targets for front running.

Slippage is the allowed price movement before a transaction is reversed, and zero tax coins are attractive to MEV bots because they only pay gas fees, not taxes to developers. And as we all know, higher gas fees = higher priority transactions.

Here's an example: A trader places a $100 buy order with 10% slippage on a zero tax coin. Jared's MEV bot swoops in, placing a buy order with sky-high gas fees to move the price by 10% and buy more than $100 worth of the coin. The bot then places a sell order right after the $100 buy order, making a profit and raising the original buyer's entry price by 10%.

Jaredfromsubway has been training his MEV bot using machine learning for years, and it's now one of the best in the market.  **He's even spent over $3M on gas fees alone to execute his attacks!**

Ironically, his name is perfect for someone performing sandwich attacks (Jaredfromsubway.eth).

With MEV bots on the rise and online tutorials teaching people how to create their own, it's crucial to stay safe and vigilant in the crypto world. Keep your eyes peeled, and happy trading!


An MEV bot run by a pseudonymous crypto individual named after a jailed sex offender made millions of dollars in arbitrage and sandwich attacks in the last three months,  [according](https://eigenphi.substack.com/p/performance-appraisal-of-jaredfromsubway-eth)  to a report by MEV tracking site EigenPhi.

The report stated that the bot made $34 million in proceeds (with revenues of $40 million minus blockchain fees of $6 million).

However, a pseudonymous MEV expert known as Yannick, who runs similar bots, claims that the actual proceeds are in the range of $3.5 million to $4.5 million. He told The Block that EigenPhi typically overestimates revenue from MEV extraction.

A person going by Jaredfromsubway.eth — a reference to the  [former spokesperson for sandwich chain Subway](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Fogle)  who was sentenced to 15 years for sex crimes — created the bot in February. It quickly found traction by sandwiching other crypto users and outperforming rival MEV bots, a term for blockchain-based high frequency trading algorithms.

As the bot has become more active, its transactions can now be found in more than 60% of Ethereum blocks, according to EigenPhi.
