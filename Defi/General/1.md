**Introduction:**
- **Announcement:** Supercharged liquidity is coming to Osmosis, enhancing capital efficiency.
- **Benefits:**

### Issues with Previous Liquidity Model:
- **Traditional Liquidity Spread:**
  - Liquidity was evenly spread, leading to inefficiency.
  - Large swaps caused significant price fluctuations and high execution costs.

### Introduction of Supercharged Liquidity:
- **Enhanced Liquidity:**
  - Concentrated liquidity increases capital efficiency.
  - Allows larger trades to be cheaper with less price impact.

**Example:**
- A $115,000 swap with 12,000 ADAM in Osmosis shows half going to a supercharged pool and half to a standard pool.
- The same assets and liquidity result in better efficiency and yield in the supercharged pool.

### Supercharged Pools vs. Standard Pools:
- **Supercharged Pools:**
  - More volume with half the liquidity.
  - Higher fees collected.
  - 90% APR compared to 19% in standard pools.

### Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and Liquidity:
- **AMM Basics:**
  - AMMs automate price discovery, ideal for small crypto markets.
  - Traditional markets require matching bids and asks, which is challenging for low liquidity assets.
- **Liquidity Providing (LPing):**
  - LPs provide liquidity and earn fees.
  - AMMs allow for passive pricing of assets.

### Constant Product AMM:
- **Formula:** K = X * Y
  - K: Constant value in the pool.
  - X: Token A.
  - Y: Token B.
- **Example:**
  - Depositing apples and oranges into a pool based on their exchange rate.
  - Fees are collected based on trades and LPs can withdraw assets.

### Standard vs. Supercharged Liquidity:
- **Standard Pools:**
  - Evenly spread liquidity.
  - Linear improvement with added liquidity.
- **Concentrated Liquidity:**
  - Liquidity focused within a specific range.
  - More capital efficient and allows larger trades with less impact.

### Mechanics of Concentrated Liquidity:
- **Range Setting:**
  - LPs can specify the range for providing liquidity.
  - Tighter ranges mean higher APR but risk going out of range.
