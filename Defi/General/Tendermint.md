### **Tendermint: A Groundbreaking Consensus Engine**

**Overview**
- **Tendermint** is a highly scalable Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus engine.
- Used by over 50 blockchains, securing billions of dollars of TVL (Total Value Locked).
- Recognized as the gold standard for PoS consensus engines, influencing many projects in the crypto space.

**Historical Background**
- The original white paper, "Tendermint Without Consensus," was published in 2014 by **Jaquan**.
- **Innovative Ideas** introduced:
  - Finality
  - High throughput
  - Proof of Stake (PoS)
- **Influence**: Cited over 500 times by major projects like Ethereum, Polkadot, Solana, Avalanche, and more.

**Impact and Recognition**
- **Cosmos' Tendermint** is ranked as the third most important project in Web 3.0, potentially the second only to Bitcoin.
- Initially, **Bitcoin Maximalists** dominated the scene with Bitcoin and its forks, relying on Proof of Work (PoW).
- **Challenges with PoW**:
  - Probabilistic finality
  - Forking issues
  - Inefficiency and high energy consumption



**Technical Details**
- **Generic Consensus Protocol**: Can run any arbitrary state machine, not just blockchains.
- **Terminology**:
  - **Nodes** instead of validators/miners
  - **State Machine** instead of blockchain
  - **State** instead of blocks

**Key Features of Tendermint**
1. **Deterministic Byzantine Fault Tolerant Replicated State Machines**:
   - **Consensus**: Agreement among nodes
   - **BFT**: Tolerates faults and malicious nodes
   - **State Machine**: Finite states with predetermined transitions
   - **Deterministic**: Same result every time, no randomness
   - **Replicated**: Multiple copies of information

2. **Operational Phases**:
   - **Proposal Phase**: A block is proposed.
   - **Pre-vote and Vote Phase**: Nodes approve or disapprove the proposed state.
   - **Commit and Pre-commit Phase**: Block is added if approved by over two-thirds of validators.

3. **Application in Proof of Stake Blockchains**:
   - **Random Block Proposers**: Chosen using a round-robin algorithm.
   - **Validator Rewards and Penalties**: Rewards for valid blocks, penalties for invalid actions.

**Security and Scalability**
- **Efficiency**: PoS networks that do not waste electricity.
- **BFT**: Handles up to one-third of the network being corrupt or offline.
- **Scalability**: Low transaction costs, high throughput even during congestion.

**Versatility**
- **ABCI**: Application Blockchain Interface separates the application from the consensus, supporting multiple programming languages.
- **General Purpose**: Used for various applications including DeFi, enterprise solutions, and privacy chains.

**Adoption and Influence**
- **Projects Using Tendermint**:
  - Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, Juno, Stargaze, Secret, Terra Luna, Akash, Umi, Injective, Crescent
  - Enterprises: Crypto.com Chain, Chronos, KuCoin Chain, OKX
  - Others: Thor Chain, Kalo, Celestial

- **Projects Forking Tendermint**:
  - Matic (Polygon)
  - Aptos and Suite (from Facebook's Libra)
  - Binance Beacon Chain

- **Influence on Other Projects**: Ethereum, Polkadot, Solana, Avalanche, Hedera Hashgraph, Internet Computer, and Phantom have all cited Tendermint.
