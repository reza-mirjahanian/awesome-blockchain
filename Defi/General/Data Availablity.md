### "Data Availability and Celestia"



---

### **Introduction**
- **What is Data Availability?**
  - **Key to Blockchains**: Especially modular ones.
  - **Importance**:
    - **Accessibility**
    - **Transparency**
    - **Immutability**

---

### **Data Availability Explained**
- **Analogy**: Recording a Soccer Game
  - **Scenario**: A popular soccer team’s game is recorded and broadcast by TV networks.
  - **Comparison**: Data availability is like the TV network ensuring anyone can replay the game (blockchain's history) and check for rule-breaking.

- **Blockchain Context**:
  - **Definition**: Ability of blockchain networks and participants to access and retrieve recorded data.
  - **Ensures**:
    - Information is stored on the blockchain.
    - Information is accessible, transparent, and immutable for all network participants.

### **Common Misconceptions about Data Availability**
1. **Data Availability is not Data Validation**
   - **Purpose**: Ensuring data is available, not verifying its accuracy.
   - **Celestia’s Role**:
     - Does not execute or validate data.
     - Records and broadcasts data for user verification.
   
2. **Data Availability is not Data Storage**
   - **Purpose**: Publicly publishing new relevant data for blockchain verification.
   - **Storage Limitation**: Does not guarantee permanent data storage.
   - **Focus**: Securing blockchain data, not keeping irrelevant data permanently.
   
3. **Data Availability and Data Permanence**
   - **Not a Long-Term Solution**: Does not keep data forever, unlike decentralized storage solutions like Arweave and Filecoin.
   - **Purpose**: Ensuring blockchain data is accessible and transparent for verification.

### **Importance of Data Availability**
- **Analogy**: Watching a Soccer Game
  - **Scenario**: High ticket prices and no streaming.
  - **Issue**: Only ticket holders can watch, making it unfair for others to verify game events.
  - **Comparison**: Data availability ensures everyone can check transaction contents, maintaining fairness and transparency.

---

### **Creating a Data Availability Layer**
- **Requirements**:
  - **Replication and Storage**: Number of nodes storing data.
    - **Mechanisms**: Full record, state and partial storage, or erasure coding (like in Celestia).
  - **Networking and Consensus**:
    - **Networking**: Sending out new data.
    - **Consensus**: Agreeing on added data.
    - **Protocol Example**: Cosmos’s Tendermint.
  - **Incentivization**:
    - **Purpose**: Encouraging nodes to participate.
    - **Forms**: Block rewards, transaction fees, grants, etc.

### **Levels of Data Availability Security**
1. **Level 0: No Data Availability Guarantee**
   - **Light Clients**: Can verify block existence but not data validity.
   
2. **Level 1: Data Availability Committee**
   - **Committee**: Group of nodes attesting to data availability, relying on majority trust.
   
3. **Level 2: Data Availability Committee with Crypto-economic Incentives**
   - **Incentives**: Stake backing data availability, common in layer ones.
   
4. **Level 3: Data Availability Sampling without Honest Minority of Light Nodes**
   - **Sampling**: Light nodes sample small portions of a block for availability.
   
5. **Level 4: Data Availability Sampling with Honest Minority of Light Nodes**
   - **Reconstruction**: Light nodes and full nodes can reconstruct withheld data.
   
6. **Level 5: Anonymous Data Availability Sampling**
   - **Anonymity**: Sampling done anonymously to prevent adversarial block producer deception.

7. **Full Node**:
   - **Highest Security**: Full nodes download and verify entire blocks, akin to attending the game in person.

### **Celestia’s Innovation**
- **Data Availability Sampling**:
  - **Benefit**: High probabilities of data availability with consumer-grade hardware.
  - **Impact**: Ensures decentralization and accessibility, enabling verification by normal users.

### **Conclusion**
- **Importance**: Data availability is crucial for blockchain decentralization.
- **Celestia’s Role**: Unlocks decentralized verification for everyone, ensuring blockchain data is secure and transparent.
