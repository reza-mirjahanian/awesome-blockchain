CosmWasm offers several advantages over the native modules of the Cosmos SDK, particularly when it comes to flexibility and interoperability:

1.  **Smart Contract Capability**: CosmWasm enables developers to write smart contracts using WebAssembly (Wasm), which can be easily integrated into any Cosmos SDK-based blockchain. This makes it ideal for creating decentralized applications (dApps) and other complex functionalities.

2.  **Interoperability**: CosmWasm's design is chain-agnostic, meaning smart contracts can be transferred across different chains without needing to recompile or redeploy. This is especially useful for multi-chain solutions.

3.  **Actor Model Design**: CosmWasm uses an actor-model design, which ensures reliable and distributed systems. This design pattern allows for better management of state and communication between contracts.

4.  **Ease of Development**: Developers can use Rust to write smart contracts, which is known for its performance and safety. Additionally, CosmWasm simplifies the process of adding smart contract support to existing Cosmos SDK chains.

5.  **Use Cases**: While native modules are great for basic functionalities, CosmWasm is better suited for more advanced use cases like DeFi applications, token standards (e.g., CW20), and other programmable features.
