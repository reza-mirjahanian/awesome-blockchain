Understanding Axelar
====================


-   Axelar is more than a bridge: it offers the ability to program cross-chain logic and pass arbitrary data.
-   The upcoming Axelar VM will allow the permissionless connection of new chains.
-   Axelar's Interchain Token Service is in testnet, which supports cross-chain transfers of native tokens rather than wrapped ones.
-   Updated tokenomics have been proposed for AXL. They would allow the network to sustainably support more chains by decreasing the rate of token inflation per added chain.
-   As of this writing, 10 of the top 15 Axelar chains by activity are EVM-based. Axelar is focused on onboarding even more EVM and Ethereum-based chains.

The fragmentation of liquidity, services, and users creates [friction](https://axelar.network/blog/axelar-virtual-machine-future-of-interoperability) across ecosystems and sovereign networks. Axelar's technology aims to allow cross-chain functions that are more complex than simply transferring wrapped assets to different blockchains. Axelar addresses this by focusing on full-stack interoperability --- with full-stack meaning that Axelar not only supports bridging any information/asset but also permissionless [overlay](https://axelar.network/blog/how-overlay-networks-could-change-web3) programmability, executing smart contracts, and dApps across networks.

The Axelar community is working to scale the number of connected networks (55 at the time of publication) through a three-pronged approach: adjusting the network's economic structure, releasing the Axelar Virtual Machine to support permissionless connections, and exploring more efficient solutions like light clients. These initiatives aim to connect Axelar to hundreds of chains.

Technology
----------

Axelar has three components:

-   A decentralized network. This is built primarily on open-source Cosmos technologies.
-   A set of gateway smart contracts that provide the connectivity between the Axelar network and its interconnected external chains.
-   A software development kit (SDK) of developer tools and APIs, including [Axelarscan](https://axelarscan.io/), a block explorer used to track cross-chain transactions.
