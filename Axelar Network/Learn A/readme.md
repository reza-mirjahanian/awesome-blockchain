Understanding Axelar
====================


-   Axelar is more than a bridge: it offers the ability to program cross-chain logic and pass arbitrary data.
-   The upcoming Axelar VM will allow the permissionless connection of new chains.
-   Axelar's Interchain Token Service is in testnet, which supports cross-chain transfers of native tokens rather than wrapped ones.
-   Updated tokenomics have been proposed for AXL. They would allow the network to sustainably support more chains by decreasing the rate of token inflation per added chain.
-   As of this writing, 10 of the top 15 Axelar chains by activity are EVM-based. Axelar is focused on onboarding even more EVM and Ethereum-based chains.
