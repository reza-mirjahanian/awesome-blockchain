# **Axelar (AXL) **

## **What is Axelar?***   A blockchain designed to **connect other blockchains** from different networks.
*   Market Ticker: **AXL**.
*   **Goal**: To develop and deploy *secure cross-chain communication* for Web3 applications.
*   **Vision**: To create the **“internet of blockchains”** as a universal development platform.

## **Key Features & Benefits**

*   Enables users to:
    *   Transfer tokens    *   Buy NFTs
    *   Play games
    *   *(and more)*
*   **Seamlessly** across different networks.
*   **No need** to wrap tokens or set up new wallets for each chain.

## **Founders & Background**

*   Founded in **2020** by *Sergey* and *Georgios*.
*   Both were founding team members at **Algorand**.## **Axelar's Core Function (Analogies)**

1.  **"Air Traffic Control System"**: Handles transportation, routing, and "border patrol" for information transfer between blockchains.
2.  **"Translator"**: Manages traffic regardless of the blockchain's programming language.

## **Important Concepts**

*   **Web3**:
    *   The next generation of the internet.
    *   Emphasizes *decentralization, user control, and enhanced privacy*.
    *   Users interact with services without central authorities, using blockchain and decentralized tech.
*   **"Internet of Blockchains"**:
    *   A vision where various blockchains *seamlessly interoperate and communicate*.
    *   Creates a unified ecosystem for trustless exchange of information and assets.
    *   Envisions a *scalable, collaborative, interconnected, versatile, user-friendly, and decentralized* blockchain infrastructure.
    *   *(Example: The Cosmos Network)*

## **How Axelar Works**

*   **Foundation**: Built on the **Cosmos** blockchain ecosystem.
    *   Uses **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** consensus.
    *   Built with the **Cosmos SDK** (framework for building blockchain apps).
    *   Uses **Tendermint** as its consensus algorithm (ensures agreement among nodes on transaction validity and order).
    *   Has the **IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) Protocol** enabled (allows interoperability within the Cosmos ecosystem).
*   **Key Differentiator from Cosmos**: Connects to blockchains *beyond* the Cosmos network.
*   **Beyond Wrapped Assets**:
    *   Traditional bridging often involves "wrapped" tokens (e.g., WBTC), which are receipts pegged 1:1 to the original asset's value.
    *   Axelar uses the **General Message Passing (GMP) protocol**.
*   **General Message Passing (GMP)**:
    *   Enables *full interoperability* between supported chains (e.g., Cosmos, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Fantom, Polygon).
    *   Allows universal connections regardless of chain or programming language.
    *   *Removes the need* for users to revert wrapped tokens to their native network before bridging to another, saving time and fees.
*   **User Benefits**:
    *   Participate in multi-chain DeFi.    *   Play games on any supported network.
    *   Buy NFTs from any marketplace.
    *   ***Without needing multiple single-use crypto wallets.***

## **AXL Tokenomics**

*   **Uses of AXL Token**:
    *   Governance
    *   Network fee payments
    *   Staking (via validators)
    *   Rewards (for node operators, governance participants, liquidity providers)
*   **Total Supply**: Just over **1.1 billion AXL**.
*   **Current Supply**: Approximately half of the total supply.
*   **Initial Allocation (1 Billion Tokens at Launch)**:
    *   **Company**: 29.5%
        *   *Core Team*: 17%
        *   *Company Operations*: 12.5%
    *   **Backers**: 29.5%        *   *Seed Round*: 13.5%
        *   *Series A*: 12.5%
        *   *Series B*: 3.5%
    *   **Community Sale**: 5%
    *   **Community Programs**: 36% (includes an insurance fund)
*   **Emission Schedule**:
    *   Tokens are released slowly over time (**vesting**).
    *   All initially allocated tokens expected to be on the market by sometime in **2026**.
*   **Wallet Distribution Concerns**:
    *   Ownership of wallets is not currently clear.
    *   Some wallets hold significant percentages (e.g., 11%, 10%).
    *   Other wallets hold 2-5%.
    *   *Potential risk* if large amounts are held by unknown entities.
    *   *(Possibility: Large wallets belong to Axelar, but this is unconfirmed)*.

## **Axelar's Outlook**

*   Builds upon the **Cosmos** foundation.
*   Aims to increase interoperability towards a **"One Blockchain" reality**.
