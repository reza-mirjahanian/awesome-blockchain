# Introduction

Blockchain consensus refers to the set of protocols and mechanisms that allow a distributed network of participants (or "nodes") to agree on the current state of a shared ledger without relying on a central authority. This agreement is critical to ensuring data integrity, preventing fraud like double-spending, and maintaining the trustless nature of blockchain networks ([Investopedia][1], [Cyfrin][2]).

These mechanisms evolved from early cryptographic research through to modern blockchain implementations. Foundations were laid by David Chaum in 1982, followed by Haber & Stornetta’s timestamped chain of records in 1991 ([Wikipedia][3]). The real-world blockchain emerged with Satoshi Nakamoto’s 2008 Bitcoin design, introducing Proof of Work (PoW) as a consensus method ([Investopedia][4], [Wikipedia][5]).

Over time, new mechanisms like Proof of Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), and hybrid or DAG-based protocols have been developed to enhance scalability, efficiency, security, and energy use ([GeeksforGeeks][6], [SpringerOpen][7], [Yield App][8], [Rapid Innovation][9]).

This glossary is organized alphabetically and spans foundational to advanced terms. It includes variations, examples, and cross-references. At the end, you'll find a section highlighting key figures and milestones, related topics, and curated resources for further exploration.

## Alphabetical Glossary

---

### **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)**

**Definition:** A fault-tolerance property of distributed systems where nodes can reach agreement even if some behave maliciously.
**Example:** PBFT (Practical BFT) in Hyperledger Fabric.
**See also:** *PBFT*, *DAG-based protocols*.

---

### **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**

**Definition:** A consensus mechanism where stakeholders vote to delegate block validation to chosen nodes.
**Example:** Used in EOS.
**Advantages:** High throughput and energy efficiency.
**Drawbacks:** Potential centralization.
**See also:** *Proof of Stake*, *BFT-DPoS (hybrid)* ([SpringerOpen][7], [Rapid Innovation][9]).

---

### **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based Consensus**

**Definition:** Instead of linear blocks, transactions form nodes in a DAG structure, allowing parallel validation.
**Examples:** IOTA’s Tangle, Nano’s Block Lattice, Hashgraph.
**Advantages:** High throughput, scalability; fewer bottlenecks.
**See also:** *Hybrid algorithms* ([SpringerOpen][7]).

---

### **Ethereum Merge**

**Definition:** The September 15, 2022 upgrade where Ethereum transitioned from PoW to PoS via merging with the Beacon Chain.
**Impact:** \~99.95% energy reduction and 90% lower ether issuance.
**See also:** *Proof of Stake* ([Investopedia][10]).

---

### **Hybrid Consensus**

**Definition:** Combines elements from multiple consensus types (e.g. PoW + PoS, DPoS + BFT) to balance security, scalability, and decentralization.
**Example:** EOS’s BFT-DPoS.
**See also:** *DPoS*, *BFT* ([SpringerOpen][7]).

---

### **Ouroboros**

**Definition:** A family of provably secure PoS consensus protocols, used by Cardano and Polkadot.
**Developed by:** Aggelos Kiayias’s team; first introduced in 2017 as one of first provable secure PoS protocols.
**Variants:** Ouroboros BFT (interim for hard fork), Praos (adaptive corruption resistance).
**See also:** *Proof of Stake* ([Wikipedia][11]).

---

### **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)**

**Definition:** A consensus protocol optimized for speed and efficiency in permissioned networks, tolerating a fraction of faulty/malicious nodes.
**Use Cases:** Enterprise blockchains and private ledgers.
**See also:** *BFT*.

---

### **Proof of Authority (PoA)**

**Definition:** Consensus where appointed authorities validate transactions, suitable for permissioned environments.
**Advantages:** Fast, low-resource.
**Drawbacks:** Centralization risk.
**See also:** *Hybrid Consensus*.

---

### **Proof of Burn (PoB)**

**Definition:** Validators “burn” (destroy) coins to earn the right to mine/validate future blocks.
**Advantages:** Commitment-based participation.
**Drawbacks:** Resource waste, economic inefficiency.
**See also:** *Proof of Stake*, *Proof of Work* ([SpringerOpen][7]).

---

### **Proof of History (PoH)**

**Definition:** A mechanism that cryptographically timestamps events to prove passage of time, used alongside PoS for ordering.
**Example:** Solana.
**See also:** *PoS*, *Hybrid Consensus*.

---

### **Proof of Space (PoSpace)**

**Definition:** Uses storage space instead of computing power to mount consensus; users allocate disk space.
**Advantages:** Energy-efficient.
**Drawbacks:** Storage centralization risk.
**See also:** *Proof of Stake* ([SpringerOpen][7]).

---

### **Proof of Stake (PoS)**

**Definition:** Validators lock up (“stake”) coins to participate in block validation; selection is often proportional to stake.
**Advantages:** Energy efficiency, scalable.
**Drawbacks:** Risk of wealth centralization ("rich get richer").
**Examples:** Ethereum post-Merge, Cardano’s Ouroboros.
**See also:** *DPoS*, *Hybrid*, *Ouroboros*, *PoB* ([GeeksforGeeks][6], [Investopedia][10], [Wikipedia][11]).

---

### **Proof of Work (PoW)**

**Definition:** Miners solve computational puzzles to validate blocks; the first solution wins the reward.
**Advantages:** Proven security and decentralization.
**Drawbacks:** Very high energy consumption; scalability limits.
**Examples:** Bitcoin.
**See also:** *PoB*, *Hybrid* ([GeeksforGeeks][6], [Investopedia][1]).

---

### **Reusable Proof of Work**

**Definition:** Early concept by Hal Finney (2004) enabling repeated PoW use for digital cash purposes.
**Note:** Precursor to Bitcoin’s PoW-based consensus.
**See also:** *Proof of Work*, *Bitcoin history* ([GeeksforGeeks][12]).

---

### **Sybil Resistance**

**Definition:** Techniques to prevent one entity from controlling multiple identities in the network to subvert consensus.
**Examples:** PoW, PoS, PoA all include Sybil resistance by cost or identity constraints.
**See also:** *Consensus Mechanism*, *Sybil Attacks* ([Cyfrin][2]).

---

### **Synthetic Consensus Components** *(from academic survey)*

**Definition:** A taxonomy describing five core functions of consensus protocols: propose, validate, propagate, finalize, incentivize.
**Use:** Useful framework for analyzing consensus designs.
**See also:** *Academic models* ([arXiv][13]).

---

### **Term: Consensus Mechanism / Consensus Algorithm**

**Definition:** The rules or systems that enable distributed nodes to agree on the blockchain’s current state without central authority.
**Synonym:** Consensus protocol.
**Example:** PoW, PoS, PBFT.
**See also:** *Sybil resistance*, *Consensus components* ([Investopedia][1], [Cyfrin][2], [CoinMarketCap][14], [GeeksforGeeks][6]).

---

### **Term: Confirmation**

**Definition:** The number of blocks added after a transaction’s block, solidifying its finality.
**Example:** Bitcoin often requires 5 confirmations for high security.
**See also:** *Finality* ([101 Blockchains][15]).
