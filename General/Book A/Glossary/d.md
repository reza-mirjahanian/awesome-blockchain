### Introduction

A blockchain consensus mechanism is a set of rules and protocols that enables a distributed network of computers, known as nodes, to agree on the current state of a shared ledger. This agreement is fundamental to the operation of any blockchain, as it ensures that all participants have a consistent and accurate version of the transaction history, thereby preventing fraud and maintaining the integrity of the network. In a decentralized environment where participants may not know or trust each other, a robust consensus mechanism is crucial for establishing a secure and reliable system for recording and verifying transactions.

The importance of consensus mechanisms lies in their ability to solve the "Byzantine Generals' Problem," a classic computer science dilemma that illustrates the challenges of achieving agreement among distributed parties who may be unreliable or malicious. By providing a framework for nodes to validate new blocks of transactions and add them to the chain, consensus mechanisms ensure that the blockchain remains a single, immutable source of truth. The evolution of these mechanisms has been driven by the pursuit of greater security, scalability, and energy efficiency, leading to a variety of approaches beyond the original Proof of Work model.

This glossary provides a comprehensive overview of the key terms, concepts, and methodologies related to blockchain consensus. It is organized into an alphabetical list of terms for easy reference. Each entry includes a concise definition, and where relevant, examples and cross-references to other related terms within the glossary. The guide also includes sections on key figures and milestones, related topics for further exploration, and a curated list of resources for deeper learning.

### Alphabetical Glossary

#### **51% Attack**
A potential attack on a blockchain network where a single entity or group gains control of more than 50% of the network's hashing power or staking influence. This majority control allows the attacker to disrupt the network by preventing new transactions from being confirmed, halting payments, and potentially reversing their own transactions to double-spend coins. While theoretically possible on any blockchain, 51% attacks are more of a threat to smaller networks with less distributed hashing power or stake.
*   **Application:** In a Proof of Work system, an attacker with 51% of the mining power could create a private version of the blockchain and eventually broadcast it as the legitimate one. In a Proof of Stake system, an attacker would need to acquire 51% of the total staked cryptocurrency.
*   **See also:** Double Spending, Hashing Power

#### **Block**
A data structure in a blockchain that contains a set of transactions. Each block is cryptographically linked to the previous block, forming a chain. A block typically includes a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a reference (or hash) to the previous block.

#### **Blockchain**
A distributed, immutable ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent manner. The ledger is composed of a series of blocks that are cryptographically linked together.

#### **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)**
The property of a system that allows it to reach consensus even if some of its components, or nodes, fail or act maliciously. This concept is derived from the "Byzantine Generals' Problem." Blockchains that are BFT can continue to operate securely and reliably, even with a certain number of faulty or dishonest nodes.
*   **See also:** Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)

#### **Consensus**
The process by which a distributed network of nodes agrees on the validity and order of transactions to be added to the blockchain. This agreement is essential for maintaining a single, consistent version of the ledger across the entire network.

#### **Consensus Mechanism**
A protocol or algorithm used by a blockchain network to achieve consensus among its distributed nodes. It provides a set of rules for validating transactions and adding new blocks to the chain, ensuring the integrity and security of the ledger.
*   **Synonym:** Consensus Protocol, Consensus Algorithm

#### **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**
A consensus mechanism that is a variation of Proof of Stake. In a DPoS system, token holders vote to elect a small number of "delegates" or "witnesses" who are responsible for validating transactions and creating new blocks. This approach is designed to be more efficient and democratic than traditional PoS, allowing for faster transaction confirmation times.
*   **Application:** Blockchains like EOS, Tron, and Lisk use DPoS.

#### **Double Spending**
A type of fraudulent transaction where the same digital currency is spent more than once. Consensus mechanisms are designed to prevent double spending by ensuring that all transactions are verified and recorded on the blockchain in a chronological and immutable manner.

#### **Hash**
A cryptographic function that takes an input of any size and produces a fixed-size string of characters, which is unique to the input data. In the context of blockchain, hashes are used to link blocks together and to ensure the integrity of the data within each block.

#### **Hashing Power**
The total combined computational power that is being used to mine and process transactions on a Proof of Work blockchain. A higher hashing power indicates a more secure network, as it would require a greater amount of computational resources for a 51% attack.
*   **Synonym:** Hash Rate

#### **Longest Chain Rule**
A principle used in many Proof of Work blockchains, including Bitcoin, to resolve forks. When two miners solve a block at roughly the same time, a temporary fork in the blockchain occurs. The longest chain rule dictates that the version of the blockchain with the most accumulated computational work (i.e., the longest chain of blocks) is considered the valid one.

#### **Miner**
A participant in a Proof of Work blockchain network who uses computational power to solve complex mathematical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks. Miners are rewarded with newly created cryptocurrency and transaction fees for their efforts.

#### **Node**
A computer that participates in a blockchain network. Nodes maintain a copy of the blockchain's ledger and work to validate and relay transactions. In some consensus mechanisms, certain nodes have special roles, such as miners or validators.

#### **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)**
A consensus algorithm designed to be efficient in asynchronous systems and tolerant of Byzantine faults. PBFT is often used in permissioned or private blockchains where the participants are known and there is a higher degree of trust. It allows for fast transaction finality as it doesn't require the energy-intensive mining of PoW.

#### **Proof of Authority (PoA)**
A reputation-based consensus mechanism where transactions and blocks are validated by a set of approved accounts, known as validators. Validators are chosen based on their identity and reputation, which they stake as collateral. This model allows for fast transactions and high scalability and is often used in private or consortium blockchains where a degree of centralization is acceptable.
*   **Application:** VeChain and certain private Ethereum networks utilize PoA.

#### **Proof of Burn (PoB)**
A consensus mechanism that requires participants to "burn" or destroy a portion of their cryptocurrency holdings by sending them to an unspendable address. This act of burning serves as a long-term commitment to the network and grants the participant the right to mine or validate new blocks. The more coins a user burns, the higher their chances of being selected to create the next block. PoB is considered an alternative to PoW that is less energy-intensive.
*   **Application:** Slimcoin is an example of a cryptocurrency that uses Proof of Burn.

#### **Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)**
A consensus mechanism developed by Intel that is often used in permissioned blockchain networks. PoET uses a lottery-like system where every node is given a random wait time. The node with the shortest wait time "wakes up" first and wins the right to create the next block. This process is managed within a trusted execution environment (TEE), like Intel's SGX, to ensure fairness and prevent manipulation. It is designed to be highly energy-efficient.
*   **Application:** Hyperledger Sawtooth is a notable project that uses PoET.

#### **Proof of Stake (PoS)**
A consensus mechanism where participants, known as validators, are chosen to create new blocks based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral. Instead of relying on computational power like PoW, PoS relies on the economic incentive of the validators to act honestly, as they risk losing their staked coins if they validate fraudulent transactions. PoS is significantly more energy-efficient than PoW.
*   **Disadvantages:** Critics argue that PoS can lead to centralization, as those with more wealth can stake more and thus have more influence. There is also the "nothing at stake" problem, where validators might be incentivized to support multiple forks.
*   **See also:** Staking, Validator

#### **Proof of Work (PoW)**
The first and most well-known blockchain consensus mechanism, introduced by Bitcoin. It requires network participants, or miners, to expend computational effort to solve a complex mathematical puzzle. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the next block to the blockchain and is rewarded with cryptocurrency. This process, known as mining, secures the network but is very energy-intensive.
*   **Disadvantages:** PoW is criticized for its high energy consumption, slow transaction speeds, and the potential for centralization of mining power.
*   **See also:** Miner, Hashing Power

#### **Staking**
The act of locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency in a wallet to participate in the validation of transactions on a Proof of Stake blockchain. By staking their coins, users become eligible to be selected as validators and earn rewards for helping to secure the network.

#### **Validator**
A participant in a Proof of Stake, Proof of Authority, or other non-PoW blockchain network who is responsible for validating transactions and creating new blocks. Validators are chosen based on the rules of the specific consensus mechanism, such as the amount of cryptocurrency they have staked or their established reputation.
