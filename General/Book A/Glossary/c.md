# Blockchain Consensus: A Comprehensive Glossary  

## Introduction  

Blockchain consensus refers to the mechanisms by which decentralized networks agree on the validity of transactions and the state of the ledger. Unlike traditional centralized systems, blockchains rely on distributed participants (nodes) to achieve trustless agreement without a central authority. Consensus protocols are critical for security, scalability, and decentralization, and they vary widely in design, from energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) to more efficient alternatives like Proof of Stake (PoS).  

This glossary covers the foundational concepts, algorithms, and terminology related to blockchain consensus. It is organized alphabetically, with cross-references to related terms. Additional sections highlight key figures, milestones, and further resources. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced learner, this guide aims to clarify the complexities of consensus in blockchain systems.

## Alphabetical Glossary  

### **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)**  
A property of a system that can resist failures caused by malicious nodes (Byzantine nodes) or network partitions. BFT is essential for consensus in adversarial environments. *Example:* Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) is a BFT algorithm used in some permissioned blockchains. *See also: [PBFT](#practical-byzantine-fault-tolerance-pbft), [Consensus](#consensus).*  

### **Consensus**  
The process by which nodes in a blockchain network agree on the validity of transactions and the current state of the ledger. Consensus ensures uniformity and security across decentralized systems. *Examples:* PoW, PoS, PBFT.  

### **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**  
A variation of PoS where token holders vote to elect a small number of delegates (or validators) to produce blocks on their behalf. DPoS aims for higher scalability and efficiency. *Example:* EOS and Tron use DPoS. *See also: [Proof of Stake](#proof-of-stake-pos).*  

### **Finality**  
The irreversible confirmation that a transaction or block is permanently added to the blockchain. Some consensus mechanisms (e.g., PoS) offer faster finality than others (e.g., PoW, which requires multiple confirmations).  

### **Fork**  
A divergence in the blockchain’s history, creating two potential paths. Forks can be accidental (due to network latency) or intentional (e.g., hard forks for protocol upgrades). *Types:* Hard fork, soft fork.  

### **Nakamoto Consensus**  
The consensus mechanism introduced by Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It combines PoW with the "longest chain rule" to achieve decentralized agreement. *See also: [Proof of Work](#proof-of-work-pow).*  

### **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)**  
A BFT consensus algorithm designed for low-latency, high-throughput systems. PBFT is used in permissioned blockchains like Hyperledger Fabric. *See also: [Byzantine Fault Tolerance](#byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft).*  

### **Proof of Authority (PoA)**  
A consensus mechanism where validators are identified and trusted entities (e.g., corporations or institutions). PoA is used in private or consortium blockchains for efficiency. *Example:* VeChain.  

### **Proof of Stake (PoS)**  
A consensus algorithm where validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they "stake" (lock up) as collateral. PoS is energy-efficient compared to PoW. *Example:* Ethereum 2.0, Cardano. *See also: [Delegated Proof of Stake](#delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos).*  

### **Proof of Work (PoW)**  
A consensus mechanism requiring nodes to solve computationally intensive puzzles to validate transactions and create blocks. PoW is secure but energy-intensive. *Example:* Bitcoin, Litecoin. *See also: [Nakamoto Consensus](#nakamoto-consensus).*  

### **Sybil Attack**  
An attack where a single entity creates multiple fake identities to gain disproportionate influence over a network. Consensus mechanisms like PoW and PoS mitigate Sybil attacks by imposing resource costs (e.g., electricity or stake).  

### **Validator**  
A participant in a consensus protocol responsible for proposing or validating blocks. In PoS, validators are chosen based on their stake; in PoW, they are miners.
