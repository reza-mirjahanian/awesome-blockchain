# Blockchain Consensus: A Comprehensive Reference Guide
## Introduction

Blockchain consensus is the family of algorithms, incentive structures, and social protocols that allow a decentralized network of mutually distrusting nodes to agree on a single, ever-growing ledger of transactions. Without consensus, a blockchain would fracture into conflicting histories, allowing double-spending and destroying the integrity of the system. Consensus therefore sits at the very heart of distributed-ledger technology, determining its security, scalability, decentralization, and energy footprint.

This glossary covers every layer of the consensus stack—from foundational cryptographic primitives (hash functions, digital signatures) to cutting-edge protocols such as Snowman, Narwhal-Bullshark, and Algorand’s VRFs. It also includes economic concepts (tokenomics, slashing), governance mechanisms (on-chain voting, social consensus), and performance metrics (TPS, finality time). Terms are arranged alphabetically, with cross-references and historical notes to show how ideas evolved from the 1980s academic literature to today’s multi-billion-dollar networks.

Whether you are a beginner learning how Proof of Work prevents Sybil attacks or an engineer comparing HotStuff vs. Tendermint for a new Layer-1 chain, this guide provides concise, accurate, and jargon-controlled definitions. Each entry is self-contained yet linked to related concepts, allowing both linear reading and quick look-ups.

## Alphabetical Glossary

**51 % Attack**  
An attack in which a single entity controls more than half of the mining (PoW) or staking (PoS) power and can therefore rewrite recent history, censor transactions, or double-spend coins.  
• Example: Bitcoin Gold suffered a 51 % attack in May 2018.  
• See also: Hashrate, Stake Distribution, Re-org.

**Accountable Safety**  
A property of BFT protocols that produces cryptographic proof when two conflicting blocks are finalized, allowing the protocol to identify and punish at least one-third of the faulty validators.  
• Introduced by Ethereum 2.0’s Casper-FFG.  
• Contrast: Probabilistic Safety.

**Adaptive Adversary**  
A security model in which the adversary can corrupt nodes dynamically, based on observed protocol messages. Protocols such as Algorand and Snow White are designed to remain secure under this stronger threat model.  
• See also: Static Adversary, Corruption Delay.

**Avalanche (Snowman) Consensus**  
A family of metastable, leaderless protocols that use repeated random subsampling and gossip to achieve consensus with low latency and high throughput. Snowman is the linearized, totally-ordered variant used by the C-Chain of Avalanche.  
• Key paper: “Snowflake to Avalanche” (Rocket, 2018).  
• See also: Metastability, Subsample Voting.

**BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance)**  
The ability of a distributed system to reach consensus even if some nodes (up to a threshold f, typically ⌊(n−1)/3⌋) behave arbitrarily (Byzantine failures).  
• Classical protocols: PBFT, Tendermint, HotStuff.  
• See also: Safety, Liveness, Partial Synchrony.

**Block Finality**  
The irreversible commitment of a block to the canonical chain.  
• Types: Probabilistic (Bitcoin), Deterministic (Tendermint), Economic (Casper).  
• Metric: Time-to-Finality (TTF).

**Byzantine Generals Problem**  
The seminal 1982 thought experiment by Lamport, Shostak, and Pease that formalizes the challenge of achieving consensus in the presence of traitorous generals.  
• See also: BFT, Impossibility of Consensus.

**Checkpoint**  
A block height designated for extra validation or finalization in protocols such as Ethereum 2.0 and Polkadot.  
• Used to limit the cost of slashing and reduce fork length.

**Committee Election**  
The process of selecting a small subset of validators to propose or attest to a block for a given slot.  
• Methods: VRF (Algorand), RANDAO (Ethereum 2.0), Round-Robin (Tendermint).

**Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**  
A PoS variant where token holders vote for a fixed set of delegates (block producers).  
• Used by EOS, Tron.  
• Trade-off: higher throughput vs. lower decentralization.

**Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA)**  
A rule in PoW systems that retargets the mining difficulty so that average block time remains constant despite hashrate fluctuations.  
• Example: Bitcoin retargets every 2,016 blocks (~2 weeks).

**Epoch**  
A fixed number of slots (or blocks) during which the validator set or stake distribution is static; epochs enable periodic rewards and penalties.  
• Ethereum 2.0 epoch = 32 slots (6.4 min).  
• See also: Slot, Finality.

**Equivocation**  
When a validator signs two different messages at the same height or round, violating protocol rules and often subject to slashing.  
• Detected in Casper via surround and double votes.

**Finality Gadget**  
An overlay protocol (e.g., Casper FFG, GRANDPA) that adds accountable safety to an underlying chain without modifying its fork-choice rule.  
• See also: Hybrid Consensus.

**Fork**  
A divergence in the blockchain state, either accidental (network latency) or intentional (protocol upgrade).  
• Types: Soft Fork, Hard Fork, Contentious Fork, State Fork.

**Gas**  
The unit measuring computational cost in smart-contract platforms; users pay gas fees to incentivize miners/validators to include their transactions.  
• EIP-1559 burns part of the fee, creating deflationary pressure.

**Gossip Protocol**  
A peer-to-peer message-propagation layer ensuring that all nodes eventually receive every block or transaction.  
• Variants: Plumtree, Epidemic Broadcast Trees.

**GRANDPA (GHOST-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement)**  
Polkadot’s finality gadget that separates block production (BABE) from finality, allowing fast block times plus accountable safety.  
• Achieves safety after 2/3 supermajority on a chain of blocks.

**Hashrate**  
The aggregate computational power per second that miners devote to a PoW network; measured in hashes/second (H/s, TH/s, EH/s).  
• See also: Hash Function, Difficulty.

**HotStuff**  
A three-phase BFT protocol that simplifies communication to linear message complexity and forms the basis of Diem (Libra) and Aptos.  
• Introduces “chaining” to pipeline consensus rounds.

**Inactivity Leak**  
A penalty in PoS protocols such as Ethereum 2.0 where offline validators lose stake until the online supermajority can finalize again.  
• Prevents liveness failures from halting the chain indefinitely.

**Liveness**  
The property that the system continues to make progress (i.e., new blocks are produced) under the specified network assumptions.  
• See also: Safety, Partial Synchrony.

**Long-Range Attack**  
An attack in PoS where an old validator set creates an alternative chain from a deep historical state; mitigated by weak subjectivity or checkpointing.  
• Contrast: Short-Range Re-org.

**MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)**  
The profit validators or searchers extract by reordering, inserting, or censoring transactions within a block.  
• Mitigations: PBS (Proposer/Builder Separation), MEV-Burn.

**Metastability**  
A state in which the system remains undecided until perturbed; exploited by Avalanche to achieve rapid convergence.  
• See also: Avalanche.

**Mining Pool**  
A cooperative group of PoW miners who share hashrate and rewards to reduce payout variance.  
• Largest pools as of 2025: Foundry USA, Antpool.

**Nakamoto Consensus**

• Offers censorship resistance at the cost of energy use.

**Nothing-at-Stake Problem**  
The theoretical issue in naive PoS where validators can vote on multiple forks without cost; solved by slashing and BFT finality.  
• See also: Slashing, Casper.

**Optimistic Rollup**  
A Layer-2 scaling technique that posts calldata to L1 and relies on fraud proofs, assuming at least one honest validator.

A class of algorithms where validators are chosen to propose blocks weighted by their economic stake, and safety is enforced by slashing.  
• Variants: Chain-based (Peercoin), BFT-style (Tendermint), Hybrid (Casper).

**Quadratic Slashing**  
Ethereum 2.0’s rule that slashings scale with the number of violators, discouraging correlated failures.

**Re-org (Reorganization)**  
A situation where a competing fork overtakes the current canonical chain, rolling back previously confirmed blocks.  
• Depth-1 re-orgs are common in Ethereum under 12-second slots.

**Safety**  
The guarantee that no two conflicting blocks can both be finalized.  
• Formalized as “no two clients decide differently.”

The average wall-clock time from transaction submission to irreversibility.  
• Bitcoin: ~60 min (6 conf), Tendermint: ~6 s, Avalanche: ~1 s.

**Unbonding Period**  
A cooldown after a validator exits or tokens are undelegated, preventing them from immediately withdrawing stake and creating long-range attacks.  
• Cosmos: 21 days, Ethereum 2.0: 27 h.
