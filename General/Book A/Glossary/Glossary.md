# Glossary

### Adversary model

The fraction of malicious or faulty nodes that the consensus protocol can tolerate (i.e., it will operate correctly despite the presence of such nodes).&#x20;

### Code available

Whether the code implementing the system is publicly available.&#x20;

### Committee

How the participants work together to participate in the consensus protocol; either they all work together (single committee), or they are divided in multiple subgroups (multiple committees).&#x20;

### Committee Formation

How the members of the committee are chosen, for example via proof-of-work, proof-of stake, trusted hardware etc.&#x20;

### Consistency

The likelihood that the system will reach consensus on a proposed value; it can be either strong or weak.&#x20;

### &#x20;DoS resistance

Resilience of the node(s) involved in consensus to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. If the participants of the consensus protocol are known in advance, an adversary may launch a DoS attack against them. &#x20;

### Incentives

The mechanisms that keep nodes motivated to participate in the system and follow its rules. • Inter-committee Conﬁguration: How the members are assigned to the committee in a single committee setting; either members serve on the committee permanently (static), or they are changed at regular intervals (rolling, or full swap).&#x20;

### Latency

The time it takes from when a transaction is proposed until consensus has been reached on it.&#x20;

### Leader

The leader of the consensus protocol, which can be either elected among the current committee (internally), externally, or ﬂexibly (e.g., through arbitrary smart contracts).&#x20;

### Participants

The nodes that participate in the consensus protocol.&#x20;

### Permissioned blockchain

Only participants selected by the appropriate authorities can participate in the consensus protocol.&#x20;

### Permissionless blockchain

Anyone can join the system and participate in the consensus protocol.&#x20;

### Scalability

The system’s ability to achieve greater throughput when consensus involves a larger number of nodes.&#x20;

### Sharding

Sharding aims to split (shard) state information across nodes, without requiring any node to have a full picture of the network. Therefore no validator will validate all shards.

### Throughput

The maximum rate at which transactions can be agreed upon by the consensus protocol (transactions per second/hour).&#x20;

### Transaction censorship resistance

The system’s resilience to proposed transactions being suppressed (i.e., censored) by malicious node(s) involved in consensus.

### &#x20;Zero Knowledge Proofs

&#x20;A Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that she knows a value X, without revealing the value itself.
