# Blockchain Consensus: A Comprehensive Glossary

## Introduction

Blockchain consensus mechanisms form the foundational layer of distributed ledger technology, enabling networks of independent participants to agree on a single version of truth without relying on a central authority. These mechanisms solve the Byzantine Generals Problemâ€”a fundamental challenge in distributed computing where network participants must coordinate despite the presence of potentially malicious actors.

The evolution of blockchain consensus has been driven by the need to balance three critical properties: security (resistance to attacks), scalability (transaction throughput), and decentralization (distribution of power). From Bitcoin's pioneering Proof of Work to modern hybrid approaches, consensus mechanisms determine how blockchain networks validate transactions, create new blocks, and maintain network integrity.

This glossary provides comprehensive coverage of consensus mechanisms, their components, variations, and related concepts. Terms are organized alphabetically with cross-references to help readers understand the interconnected nature of blockchain consensus. Whether you're a developer implementing consensus algorithms, a researcher exploring new mechanisms, or an enthusiast seeking to understand blockchain fundamentals, this guide offers clear definitions and practical context for each concept.

## Alphabetical Glossary

**51% Attack**
An attack scenario where a single entity or coordinated group controls more than half of a blockchain network's mining power or stake, enabling them to potentially reverse transactions, prevent new transactions from being confirmed, or double-spend coins. Also known as a majority attack, this represents one of the primary security concerns for smaller blockchain networks.

**Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT)**
A consensus mechanism that can achieve agreement among distributed nodes even when network messages may be delayed indefinitely or delivered out of order. Unlike traditional BFT, aBFT doesn't rely on timing assumptions, making it more robust against network partitions and timing attacks.
- Examples: Hashgraph, Fantom's Lachesis protocol
- *See also: Byzantine Fault Tolerance, Finality*

**Authority Nodes**
Designated nodes in Proof of Authority networks that have the exclusive right to validate transactions and create new blocks. These nodes are typically known entities whose reputation serves as collateral for honest behavior.
- *See also: Proof of Authority, Permissioned Blockchain*

**Block Producer**
Any node responsible for creating new blocks in a blockchain network. The term is often used in Delegated Proof of Stake systems but can apply to miners in PoW or validators in PoS systems.
- *See also: Miner, Validator, Witness*

**Block Reward**
The incentive mechanism that compensates block producers for their computational work or stake in securing the network. Typically consists of newly minted cryptocurrency (block subsidy) plus transaction fees from included transactions.
- Historical note: Bitcoin's block reward halves approximately every four years
- *See also: Coinbase Transaction, Halving, Transaction Fees*

**Block Time**
The average duration between the creation of consecutive blocks in a blockchain. This metric varies significantly across different consensus mechanisms and networks (e.g., ~10 minutes for Bitcoin, ~15 seconds for Ethereum).
- *See also: Difficulty Adjustment, Network Latency*

**Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)**
The property of a distributed system to continue operating correctly even when some nodes fail or act maliciously. Named after the Byzantine Generals Problem, BFT consensus can typically tolerate up to one-third of nodes being faulty.
