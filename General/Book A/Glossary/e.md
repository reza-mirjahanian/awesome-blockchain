## Alphabetical Glossary

**51% Attack**  
A vulnerability in some blockchain consensus mechanisms, particularly Proof of Work, where an entity controlling over 50% of the network’s computational power or stake can manipulate the ledger by rewriting transaction history or double-spending.  
*Example*: In Bitcoin, a 51% attack could allow a miner to reverse transactions they sent, though the cost is often prohibitive.  
*See also*: Proof of Work, Double-Spending.

**Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT)**  
A consensus mechanism designed for high fault tolerance in asynchronous networks, capable of handling up to one-third of nodes being malicious or failing without disrupting agreement.  
*Example*: Used in systems like Hyperledger Fabric for enterprise blockchains.  
*Historical Note*: Extends Byzantine Fault Tolerance for environments with unpredictable message delivery times.

**Block**  
A data structure in a blockchain containing a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block, validated through a consensus mechanism.  
*Example*: In Ethereum, a block includes smart contract executions and is added via Proof of Stake.  
*See also*: Blockchain, Transaction.

**Block Finality**  
The property of a blockchain where, once a block is added, it is permanently included in the ledger and cannot be altered or reversed.  
*Example*: Tendermint achieves deterministic finality, unlike Bitcoin’s probabilistic finality.  
*See also*: Probabilistic Finality, Deterministic Finality.

**Blockchain**  
A decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions across multiple nodes, relying on a consensus mechanism to ensure agreement on the ledger’s state.  
*Example*: Bitcoin’s blockchain uses Proof of Work to validate transactions.  
*See also*: Distributed Ledger, Consensus Mechanism.

**Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)**  
A property of distributed systems that ensures consensus despite up to one-third of nodes behaving maliciously or failing.  
*Example*: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) is used in permissioned blockchains like Hyperledger.  
*Historical Note*: Originates from the Byzantine Generals Problem, introduced by Leslie Lamport in 1982.  
*See also*: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance, Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance.

**Consensus Mechanism**  
A protocol used by a blockchain network to achieve agreement among nodes on the validity and order of transactions.  
*Example*: Bitcoin uses Proof of Work, while Ethereum uses Proof of Stake.  
*See also*: Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Delegated Proof of Stake.

**Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**  
A consensus mechanism where token holders vote for a small number of delegates to validate transactions and produce blocks, improving scalability over traditional Proof of Stake.  
*Example*: EOS uses DPoS with 21 elected block producers.  
*See also*: Proof of Stake, Block Producer.

**Deterministic Finality**  
A type of finality where a block, once added to the blockchain, is guaranteed to remain permanent without the possibility of reversal.  
*Example*: Algorand’s consensus ensures deterministic finality.  
*See also*: Block Finality, Probabilistic Finality.

**Double-Spending**  
A potential issue in digital currencies where the same funds are spent multiple times, prevented by consensus mechanisms ensuring transaction validity.  
*Example*: Bitcoin’s Proof of Work prevents double-spending by requiring miners to agree on a single transaction history.  
*See also*: 51% Attack, Proof of Work.

**Fork**  
A split in a blockchain’s ledger when nodes disagree on the consensus rules, resulting in two or more divergent chains.  
*Example*: Bitcoin Cash forked from Bitcoin in 2017 over block size disputes.  
*Variations*: Hard fork (incompatible changes) and soft fork (backward-compatible changes).  
*See also*: Consensus Mechanism, Block.

**Gossip Protocol**  
A communication method where nodes share information with a subset of peers, which then propagate it further, often used in blockchain consensus for efficiency.  
*Example*: Ethereum uses gossip protocols to broadcast transactions.  
*See also*: Network Propagation.

**Hashrate**  
The computational power used by miners in a Proof of Work blockchain to solve cryptographic puzzles and validate blocks.  
*Example*: Bitcoin’s hashrate is measured in exahashes per second (EH/s).  
*See also*: Proof of Work, Mining.

**Leader Election**  
The process of selecting a node to propose or validate the next block in some consensus mechanisms.  
*Example*: In Tendermint, nodes take turns as leaders in a round-robin fashion.  
*See also*: Block Producer, Tendermint.

**Longest Chain Rule**  
A rule in Proof of Work blockchains where the chain with the most cumulative computational work (longest chain) is considered the valid one.  
*Example*: Bitcoin nodes follow the longest chain to resolve forks.  
*See also*: Proof of Work, Fork.

**Mining**  
The process of using computational power to solve cryptographic puzzles in Proof of Work blockchains, validating transactions and earning rewards.  
*Example*: Bitcoin miners compete to find a nonce that produces a valid block hash.  
*See also*: Proof of Work, Hashrate.

**Nakamoto Consensus**  
The consensus mechanism introduced by Bitcoin, combining Proof of Work with the longest chain rule to achieve agreement in a decentralized network.  
*Example*: Bitcoin’s Nakamoto Consensus ensures security through computational difficulty.  
*Historical Note*: Named after Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.  
*See also*: Proof of Work, Longest Chain Rule.

**Network Propagation**  
The process by which transactions or blocks are broadcast across a blockchain network’s nodes to achieve consensus.  
*Example*: Bitcoin nodes relay transactions using a gossip protocol.  
*See also*: Gossip Protocol, Transaction.

**Node**  
A computer participating in a blockchain network, responsible for validating, storing, and propagating transactions or blocks.  
*Example*: A Bitcoin full node stores the entire blockchain and verifies transactions.  
*Variations*: Full node, light node, validator node.  
*See also*: Validator, Blockchain.

**Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)**  
A consensus algorithm for permissioned blockchains that achieves agreement among nodes despite up to one-third being malicious, using multiple rounds of voting.  
*Example*: Hyperledger Fabric uses PBFT for enterprise applications.  
*See also*: Byzantine Fault Tolerance, Permissioned Blockchain.

**Permissioned Blockchain**  
A blockchain where access to participate in consensus or validate transactions is restricted to authorized nodes.  
*Example*: Hyperledger Fabric uses PBFT in permissioned settings.  
*See also*: Permissionless Blockchain, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance.

**Permissionless Blockchain**  
A blockchain where any participant can join the network and contribute to consensus without requiring approval.  
*Example*: Bitcoin and Ethereum are permissionless blockchains.  
*See also*: Permissioned Blockchain, Consensus Mechanism.

**Probabilistic Finality**  
A type of finality where a block’s inclusion in the blockchain becomes increasingly likely but is not guaranteed, common in Proof of Work systems.  
*Example*: Bitcoin transactions gain confidence with more confirmations.  
*See also*: Deterministic Finality, Block Finality.

**Proof of Authority (PoA)**  
A consensus mechanism where a pre-selected set of trusted nodes (authorities) validate transactions and produce blocks.  
*Example*: Used in private blockchains like VeChain.  
*See also*: Permissioned Blockchain, Validator.

**Proof of Stake (PoS)**  
A consensus mechanism where validators are chosen to create blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and stake, reducing energy consumption compared to Proof of Work.  
*Example*: Ethereum transitioned to PoS in 2022 with the Merge.  
*See also*: Delegated Proof of Stake, Validator.

**Proof of Work (PoW)**  
A consensus mechanism requiring nodes (miners) to solve computationally intensive puzzles to validate transactions and add blocks, ensuring security through resource expenditure.  
*Example*: Bitcoin uses PoW, with miners competing to solve SHA-256 puzzles.  
*See also*: Mining, Hashrate, Nakamoto Consensus.

**Smart Contract**  
Self-executing code on a blockchain that automatically enforces agreement terms when conditions are met, often requiring consensus to validate execution.

**Tendermint**  
A BFT-based consensus protocol for permissioned and permissionless blockchains, providing deterministic finality through a leader-based voting system.  
*Example*: Used in the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem.  
*See also*: Byzantine Fault Tolerance, Leader Election.

**Transaction**  
A record of value transfer or state change on a blockchain, validated through a consensus mechanism.
