# Introduction

Blockchain consensus refers to the mechanisms and protocols that enable distributed networks of nodes to agree on the validity and order of transactions without relying on a central authority. This is fundamental to blockchain technology, as it ensures the integrity, security, and immutability of the ledger in a decentralized environment. Originating from solutions to the Byzantine Generals Problem, consensus mechanisms address challenges like double-spending, network faults, and malicious attacks, allowing participants to reach a shared truth. The importance of consensus lies in its role in fostering trust in permissionless systems, powering cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and enabling applications in finance, supply chains, and beyond. As blockchain evolves, consensus mechanisms balance the "blockchain trilemma" of scalability, security, and decentralization, with innovations driven by energy efficiency concerns and emerging technologies like AI.

The scope of this glossary encompasses foundational concepts for beginners, such as basic definitions of consensus and common attacks, intermediate topics like specific mechanisms (e.g., Proof of Work and Proof of Stake), and advanced ideas including hybrid models, DAG-based approaches, and AI integrations. It draws from historical developments starting with early distributed systems algorithms to recent 2025 advancements in AI-enhanced consensus. The glossary is organized alphabetically for easy reference, with each term including a definition, examples, and cross-references. Additional sections cover key figures and milestones, related topics, and curated resources to provide a complete reference guide.

# Alphabetical Glossary

**51% Attack**  
A security vulnerability where an entity controls more than 50% of the network's computational power (in PoW) or stake (in PoS), allowing them to manipulate the blockchain by reversing transactions or double-spending. This attack exploits the majority-rule nature of many consensus mechanisms. Example: In Bitcoin, a 51% attack could orphan legitimate blocks. See also: Byzantine Fault Tolerance, Sybil Attack.

**Block Reward**  
The incentive given to miners or validators for successfully adding a new block to the blockchain, typically in the form of newly minted cryptocurrency plus transaction fees. It encourages participation but decreases over time in mechanisms like PoW to control supply. Example: Bitcoin's block reward halves approximately every four years. Synonyms: Mining Reward. See also: Halving, Miner.

**Blockchain Trilemma**  
The challenge of achieving optimal scalability, security, and decentralization simultaneously in blockchain systems, as improving one aspect often compromises the others. Coined by Vitalik Buterin, it drives innovation in consensus design. Example: PoW excels in security and decentralization but struggles with scalability. See also: Scalability, Sharding.

**Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)**  
A property of distributed systems that allows consensus even when some nodes fail or act maliciously, inspired by the Byzantine Generals Problem. It ensures the network remains operational as long as faulty nodes are below a threshold (e.g., one-third). Variations include PBFT for practical applications. Example: Used in permissioned blockchains like Hyperledger Fabric. Antonyms: Crash Fault Tolerance. See also: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance.

**Byzantine Generals Problem**  
A theoretical dilemma where distributed parties must coordinate actions despite potential traitors or unreliable communication, formalized in 1982. It underpins blockchain consensus by modeling how nodes agree on transaction validity. Etymology: Derived from a metaphor of Byzantine generals besieging a city. See also: Byzantine Fault Tolerance.

**Consensus Mechanism**  
The protocol or algorithm used in blockchain networks to achieve agreement among distributed nodes on the state of the ledger, ensuring all copies are identical. It prevents conflicts like double-spending and maintains trust without a central authority. Example: PoW in Bitcoin. Synonyms: Consensus Algorithm. See also: Nakamoto Consensus.

**DAG-based Consensus**  
A consensus approach using Directed Acyclic Graphs instead of linear chains, where transactions reference previous ones for validation, enabling parallel processing and higher throughput. It avoids traditional blocks and miners. Variations include Tangle and Block Lattice. Advantages: Scalability; Disadvantages: Potential double-spending risks. Example: IOTA's Tangle for IoT transactions. See also: Directed Acyclic Graph.

**Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW)**  
A mechanism that enhances security by notarizing blocks from one chain onto another (e.g., Bitcoin) periodically, preventing attacks on smaller networks. It combines PoW with external checkpoints. Advantages: Added security for sidechains; Disadvantages: Increased complexity. Example: Used in Komodo blockchain.

**Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**  
A variant of PoS where token holders vote for a limited number of delegates to validate transactions and create blocks, improving efficiency and scalability. It introduces democracy but risks centralization. Example: EOS blockchain. See also: Proof of Stake.
- **Variations**: Liquid Proof of Stake (LPoS) allows stake delegation without transfer.
- **Applications**: High-throughput networks.

**Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**  
A data structure for organizing transactions in a non-linear, acyclic graph, used in consensus to allow asynchronous validation and avoid bottlenecks. It supports fee-less microtransactions. Example: Nano's Block Lattice. See also: DAG-based Consensus.

**Double-Spending**  
The risk of spending the same digital asset more than once, which consensus mechanisms prevent by ensuring transaction uniqueness and order. It's a core problem solved by blockchain. Example: PoW's longest chain rule resolves potential doubles. See also: Finality.

**Finality**  
The assurance that a transaction is irreversible once added to the blockchain. Probabilistic finality (e.g., in PoW) relies on chain length, while absolute finality (e.g., in PBFT) provides immediate guarantees. Example: Ethereum's PoS offers economic finality via slashing. See also: Fork.

**Fork**  
A divergence in the blockchain where two or more versions exist due to rule changes or conflicts. Hard forks create incompatible chains; soft forks are backward-compatible. Example: Bitcoin Cash hard fork from Bitcoin. See also: Orphan Block.
- **Historical Notes**: Ethereum's DAO fork in 2016 split the community.

**Grinding Attack**  
An exploit in PoS where validators try multiple chain histories to maximize rewards, mitigated by penalties or randomization. It's related to the nothing-at-stake problem. See also: Nothing-at-Stake Problem.

**Halving**  
An event in PoW blockchains where the block reward is reduced by half to control inflation, occurring at fixed intervals. It impacts miner incentives and token scarcity. Example: Bitcoin halvings every 210,000 blocks. See also: Block Reward.

**Hashgraph Consensus**  
A PoS-based mechanism using gossip protocols and virtual voting for fast, fair consensus without traditional mining. It achieves ACID compliance and high throughput. Advantages: Efficiency; Disadvantages: Potential centralization. Example: Hedera Hashgraph. See also: Gossip Protocol.

**Hybrid Consensus**  
A mechanism combining elements of multiple algorithms (e.g., PoW and PoS) to leverage strengths like security and efficiency. It adapts to network needs. Example: Decred's hybrid PoW/PoS. See also: Proof of Activity.
