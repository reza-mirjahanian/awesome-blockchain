# Performance indicators

### Throughput

Represents the number of TPS (i.e. transactions per second) a consensus algorithm can process.&#x20;

### Scalability

Represents the ability for a system to expand without degrading performance. Generally the throughput of a system is directly affected by scalability.&#x20;

### Fault tolerance threshold

Indicates an upper bound of faulty nodes that directly impacts the performance of the consensus algorithm. For example, some consensus algorithms have an optimistic regime that favors performance.

### Latency

Also known as finality in this context, it represents the time it takes for a transaction to become settled in the ledger.
