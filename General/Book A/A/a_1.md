## üîê Fundamentals of Blockchain Consensus

*Consensus algorithms enable network participants to agree on the contents of a blockchain in a distributed and trust-less manner.*



### ‚öñÔ∏è The Blockchain Trilemma

*The trilemma claims that blockchain systems can only at most have two of the following three properties:*

- **Scalability**  
  *defined as being able to process O(n) > O(c) transactions*

- **Security**  
  *defined as being secure against attackers with up to O(n) resources*

- **Decentralization**  
  *defined as the system being able to run in a scenario where each participant only has access to O(c) resources*

### üìê The CAP Theorem

*States that in case of a partition, a distributed system can only preserve either consistency or availability.*

- **A (Availability)**  
  *System continues to operate even with node failures*

- **C (Consistency)**  
  *All clients see current data regardless of update/delete*

- **P (Partition Tolerance)**  
  *The system continues to operate despite network failures*

*Systems must choose between CP, AP, or CA configurations.*

## üîó Proof of Work (PoW)

*Each participant on the network can participate in the block generation. In order to confirm the transaction and enter a block into the blockchain, a miner has to provide an answer, or proof, to a specific computational challenge.*

  *Distance Hdac*

## üåê DAG-Based Consensus

*In order to send a new transaction, you need to validate two previous transactions you're received. The two-for-one, pay-it-forward consensus strengthens the validity of transactions the more transactions are added to the Tangle.*

## üóÉÔ∏è Other Consensus Mechanisms

### üî≤ Proof of Capacity/Space

*Proof-of-space, also called Proof-of-capacity, is a means of showing that one has a legitimate interest in a service by allocating a non-trivial amount of memory or disk space to solve a challenge presented by the service provider.*

## üí° Key Considerations

*Each consensus algorithm has its own application scenario. There is no absolute good or bad. The choice of which consensus to use for implementing the blockchain depends on the type of network and data.*

*For a transaction to be valid on most cryptocurrency networks, the transaction needs to collect a certain number of confirmations (often equals to an inclusion in a block of a blockchain) from the network.*
