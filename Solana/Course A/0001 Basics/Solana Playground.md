Your browser's local storage saves your Playground Wallet. Clearing your browser cache removes your saved wallet. Use your Playground Wallet only for testing and development. Don't send real assets (from mainnet) to this address.


-   *wallet address*: a 32-byte public key from a Ed25519 keypair, generally displayed as a base-58 encoded string (e.g.,Â `7MNj7pL1y7XpPnN7ZeuaE4ctwg3WeufbX5o85sA91J1`). The corresponding private key signs transactions from this address. On Solana, an address serves as the unique identifier for a user's wallet, a program (smart contract), or any other account on the network.
-   *connected cluster*: the Solana network for your current interactions. Common clusters include:
    -   `devnet`: A development network for developer experimentation
    -   `testnet`: A network reserved for validator testing (don't use as app developer)
    -   `mainnet-beta`: The main Solana network for live transactions
