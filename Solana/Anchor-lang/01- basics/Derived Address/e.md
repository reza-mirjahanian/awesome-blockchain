A **Program Derived Address (PDA)** in the Anchor framework is a deterministic, program-owned account address on the Solana blockchain, generated from a combination of predefined seeds and the program ID. PDAs enable programs to securely create and manage accounts without private keys, facilitating trustless interactions like escrow or state storage [1][2][3].

### How PDAs Work in Anchor

- **Derivation**: PDAs are created by hashing an array of seeds (which can be static bytes or dynamic data like public keys) together with the program ID, then finding an address off the Ed25519 curve (ensuring no private key exists for it). A "bump" seed is used to guarantee this off-curve property [1][3].
- **Seeds and Bump**: Anchor requires specifying seeds and bump together in account constraints to derive and verify the PDA address at runtime. Seeds can include static strings or dynamic references such as signer public keys or other account data [1][4].
- **Account Constraints**: In Anchor, PDAs are declared in the `#[account]` attribute with constraints like `seeds`, `bump`, `init_if_needed`, `payer`, and `space` to create or access PDA accounts safely and deterministically [1][4].

### Example Usage

In an Anchor program, you might define a PDA account for storing a restaurant review as follows:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(restaurant: String)]
pub struct ReviewAccounts<'info> {
  #[account(
    init_if_needed,
    payer = signer,
    space = 500,
    seeds = [restaurant.as_bytes().as_ref(), signer.key().as_ref()],
    bump
  )]
  pub review: Account<'info, Review>,
  #[account(mut)]
  pub signer: Signer<'info>,
  pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

Here, the PDA is derived from the restaurant name and the signer's public key, ensuring a unique address per reviewer-restaurant pair. The `init_if_needed` flag creates the account if it doesn't exist, with the signer paying rent [3][4].

### Benefits of Using PDAs in Anchor

- **Deterministic Addressing**: Clients can predict PDA addresses from known seeds without querying the blockchain.
- **Program Ownership**: PDAs are owned by the program, preventing unauthorized access or control.
- **Security**: No private keys exist for PDAs, reducing attack vectors.
- **Simplified Client Logic**: Anchor includes PDA seeds in the IDL, enabling clients to automatically resolve addresses [1][4].

PDAs are fundamental in Anchor for building secure, scalable Solana programs that manage state and assets programmatically without relying on user keypairs [1][3][4].
