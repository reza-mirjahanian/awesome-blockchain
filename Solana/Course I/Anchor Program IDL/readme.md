The IDL (Interface Definition Language) is a JSON file that describes how to interact with a Solana program. It is automatically generated by the Anchor framework.

There is nothing special about the function called "initialize" --- it's a name Anchor picks. What we will learn in this tutorial is how the typescript unit tests are able to "find" the appropriate function.

Let's create a new project called `anchor-function-tutorial` and change the name in the initialize function to `boaty_mc_boatface`, keeping everything else the same.

```
pub fn boaty_mc_boatface(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
    Ok(())
}

```

Now let's change the test to the following

```
it("Call boaty mcboatface", async () => {
  // Add your test here.
  const tx = await program.methods.boatyMcBoatface().rpc();
  console.log("Your transaction signature", tx);
});

```

Now run the tests with `anchor test --skip-local-validator`

It runs as expected. So how did this sorcery work?
