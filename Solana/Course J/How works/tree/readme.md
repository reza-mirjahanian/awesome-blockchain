**Why Build on Solana?**
========================

Solana is a leading blockchain platform that offers developers **high speed** (currently capable of processing [2000--3000 TPS](https://explorer.solana.com/)), **low fees** (which can be as low as **$0.00025 per transaction**), and flexible tools for building decentralized applications (dApps). This exceptional performance stems from Solana's innovative architecture, which utilizes a **Solana Virtual MachineSVM**** *that is built upon* ***Sealevel*** and ***Proof of History (PoH)*** algorithm*.*


Sealevel:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Sealevel** Multi-threaded runtime maximizes performance by efficiently utilizing hardware through parallel processing across validator cores. This enables better scalability as hardware advances. Unlike EVM chains with global fees, Sealevel facilitates localized fee markets, allowing fees to be tailored per smart contract, preventing unrelated transactions (like NFT minting) from impacting swap or DeFi fees.
