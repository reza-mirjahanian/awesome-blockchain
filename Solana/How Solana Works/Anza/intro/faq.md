# 🧩 Validator FAQ — Snappy Edition

## 🌵 **Agave** vs Other Clients  
- **Agave** = the original Solana validator **renamed & maintained by Anza** (2024 fork).  
- Still **#1** today, but expect **multi-client future** — do your homework before choosing.

## 🖥️ What Exactly Is a Validator?  
> A computer running **validator software** that **verifies transactions** and **secures Solana**.  
Two flavors:  
1. **Voting validator** – joins consensus, votes on blocks.  
2. **Non-voting / RPC** – serves API calls, **no votes**.

## 🌐 Quick Definitions  
| Term | One-Liner |
|------|-----------|
| **Cluster** | A set of validators processing the same ledger (mainnet, testnet, devnet). |
| **RPC Node** | Non-voting validator that **answers JSON-RPC requests** from dApps & users. |
| **Proof of Stake** | Stake tokens → earn rewards → secure network. |
| **Proof of Work** | **NOT** used by Solana; no mining rigs here. |

- **No validator cap** – the more, the merrier.  
- Voting validators pay **~1.1 SOL/day** in vote fees.
