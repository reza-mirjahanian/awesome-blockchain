## Understanding Solana RPCs  🌐

* **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)** — *Interface that enables developers to fetch on-chain data by invoking methods exposed by blockchain nodes.*
* **RPC Nodes** — *Participants in the Solana network that expose JSON-RPC methods for querying the ledger directly.*

---

## RPCs vs APIs  🔄

* **Traditional APIs** rely on centralized providers (e.g., Stripe, Plaid) to supply data.
* **Blockchain RPCs**, by contrast, offer open, permissionless access—*delivered directly from the ledger via decentralized nodes, typically through HTTP + JSON-RPC*.

---

## Key Differences: Traditional vs. Blockchain RPCs

* **Data Access**

  * *Traditional RPCs*: Controlled and centralized.
  * *Blockchain RPCs*: Public and decentralized.
* **Security & Trust**

  * *Traditional RPCs*: Requires trust in a single entity.
  * *Blockchain RPCs*: Enhanced security via data validation across distributed nodes.
* **Performance Optimization**

  * Solana RPCs are *fine-tuned for low latency and high throughput*, supporting real-time decentralized application demands.

## Working with Solana RPCs  🖥️

* **Mainnet RPC**

  * Send a JSON-RPC request to endpoints like `getBlock` to fetch data.
* **Devnet RPC**

  * Similar usage pattern, but querying a separate testing cluster with independent state and history.

---

## Validators vs. RPC Nodes  ⚖️

* **Validators**

  * Participate in consensus—*validate and vote on blocks*.
* **RPC Nodes**

  * Do **not** vote; instead, they *serve on-chain data* in response to queries.
  * In contrast to ecosystems like Ethereum—*where RPC and validator roles often overlap*—Solana separates these functions.
