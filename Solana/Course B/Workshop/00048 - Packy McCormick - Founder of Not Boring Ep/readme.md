### üìà Investment Philosophy & Strategy

  * **Fund Name:** Not Boring Capital

  * **Fund Size:** $10 million

  * **Investment Scope:** We invest across all stages, geographies, and verticals. üöÄ

  * **Asset Allocation:**

      * **80% Traditional Businesses (Web2):** Software, fintech, health tech, and other "unsexy" but huge categories.
      * **20% Crypto & Web3:** Pushing up against the maximum non-qualifying limit.

  * **Core Thesis:** My worldview is bullish on **tech and innovation** as a whole.

      * Crypto is not the answer to every problem.
      * It's crucial to pick the **best stack** for whatever you're building.
      * Adoption cycles are long, creating massive opportunities in both Web2 and Web3 simultaneously.

### üåê Web2: Unsexy Categories are Ripe for Disruption

  * There are still huge, unsexy industries completely ready for a technology overhaul.
  * **Example: Restaurant Supply Chain Management** üçΩÔ∏è
    1.  **The Old Way:** Restaurants receive multiple, non-searchable PDFs from suppliers each week. They manually scan through thousands of items to place orders.
    2.  **The Innovation:** A company creates a backend system to streamline ordering without changing the restaurant's frontend interface.
  * **Why Now?**
      * **Economic Pressure:** Post-pandemic, restaurants are hyper-aware of costs and profitability, making them more willing to try new solutions.
      * **New Approaches:** Innovators are finding less disruptive ways to implement better technology.

### ‚õìÔ∏è Web3 & The "Maximalist Minimalist" View

  * *I'm a "maximalist minimalist" - I don't think crypto is going to eat everything, yet or maybe ever.*
  * **Analogy to Web 2.0:**
      * Web 2.0 was defined by dynamic, interactive interfaces (social media).
      * However, many massive, successful Web 2.0 companies were **not** social media (e.g., traditional SaaS).
  * **The Takeaway:**
      * Web3 will be a foundational layer, but many successful ventures will still be built on Web2 stacks.
      * The goal is to use the right tool for the job. Some use cases are perfectly suited for crypto, and some are not.

### ‚öõÔ∏è The "Business Physics" of Crypto

  * When evaluating a crypto project, I try to understand what fundamental *business physics laws* it's enhancing.
  * **Key Levers:**
      * **Ownership & Network Effects:** ü§ù
          * Crypto's superpower is the ability to grant users true ownership.
          * This builds powerful, defensible network effects by aligning incentives.
      * **Negative Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** üí∏
          * *Definition: Essentially paying users to adopt your product or service.*
          * This is the foundation of **yield farming** in DeFi.
          * Projects can give away their own tokens to attract an initial user base.
      * **Retention Tools:** Crypto provides novel mechanisms for user retention and engagement through tokenomics.

<!-- end list -->

```
// Simplified Yield Farming Concept

function attractUsers(newUser) {
  // Give the new user free governance tokens for joining
  token.mint(newUser, 100);
  
  // Reward them with more tokens for providing liquidity
  if (newUser.providesLiquidity > 0) {
    reward(newUser, LIQUIDITY_REWARD_RATE);
  }
}
```

  * This is uniquely difficult for traditional Web2 companies, as giving away equity involves immense legal and financial friction.

-----

### üåâ Blurring the Lines: Hybrid Web2/Web3 Models

  * Companies are increasingly adopting a hybrid approach rather than going "full decentralized."
  * **Common Implementations:**
      * **DAOs for Governance:** A company might use a DAO to allow members to vote on specific community decisions (e.g., what asset to acquire next).
      * **NFTs for Engagement:** Incorporating NFTs into a specific part of the business where it makes sense for community, loyalty, or digital goods.
  * **Is Adding Crypto a Red Flag? üö© It Depends\!**
      * **Red Flag:** When a mature company with a product suddenly pivots to crypto, it can signal they haven't found product-market fit and are chasing a shiny new trend.
      * **Green Flag:** ‚úÖ When an early-stage project uses crypto to solve a specific problem, like incentivizing user contributions or improving retention in a community-driven product.

-----

### üëü The Skeuomorphism Trap

  * ***Skeuomorphism:*** *The design concept of making new items resemble their real-world counterparts.*
  * In crypto, this often means cloning a Web2 product and just adding a token.
      * **Example:** Bitclout was essentially "Twitter with coins."
  * **The Investment Insight:**
      * The next breakthrough social network **won't** look like a Web2 clone.
      * It will be something fundamentally new and native to Web3 principles.
      * **Potential Architectures:**
          * Wallet-first identity.
          * Set in a 3D, immersive world.
          * Built around completely new interaction mechanics.

-----

### üèõÔ∏è DAOs: The New Frontier of Organization

  * **The Promise:** To organize and incentivize massive, globally distributed groups of people to work toward a common goal. üåç
  * **The "Let a Thousand Flowers Bloom" Phase:** We are in a period of wild experimentation.
      * Some DAOs will produce incredible, emergent results impossible in a traditional corporate structure.
      * Many will fail due to a lack of clear leadership or political infighting.
  * **Key Challenges:**
      * **Human Nature:** Most people are accustomed to hierarchical structures.
      * **Decision Making:** How do you build a great product without a singular "visionary" or a clear roadmap?
      * **Politics:** In a flat structure without a CEO, politics can quickly get out of hand.
  * **The Future of DAOs:**
      * **Delegation:** Token holders will delegate votes to trusted experts.
      * **Reputation Systems:** On-chain activity will build a verifiable "resume," giving more weight to proven contributors.
  * **A Guiding Principle:**
    > *"Decentralization is not the absence of leadership, it's the abundance of leadership."*

### üéÆ Play-to-Earn (P2E) & The Future of Work

  * **Axie Infinity** is the prime example of the P2E model's power.
  * **The Core Idea:** People have agency and will opt into systems where the economic trade-off makes sense for them.
      * For an unemployed person in the Philippines, playing a game to earn a living is an incredible option.
      * For a high-earning professional in the West, the time/reward trade-off may not make sense.
  * **The Evolution of P2E:**
    1.  **Phase 1: Play-to-Earn.** The "earn" aspect is front and center to attract early adopters.
    2.  **Phase 2: Play *and* Earn.** The earning mechanics will fade into the background, becoming a seamless part of a great gaming experience. You accumulate real value simply by playing.
  * **The Philosophical Shift:** \* In a future with widespread automation, traditional work may no longer be necessary for survival.
      * Humans will still need to find meaning and purpose. P2E and metaverse-based economies could provide that.

### üñ•Ô∏è The Interface Phase: Experiencing Web3

  * Major technology shifts are often unlocked by a new user interface.
      * **Web1 (Read-Only):** Needed a graphical interface like **Netscape** to become accessible.
      * **Web2 (Read-Write):** Needed interactive interfaces like **Digg** and **Facebook** to thrive.
  * **Web3 (Read-Write-Own):** The definitive interface has not yet emerged.
  * **Top Contenders:**
      * **The Wallet:** ü¶ä The wallet could become the central hub for identity, social connections, and assets, making the entire Web3 ecosystem portable.
      * **The Metaverse:** üëì A 3D, immersive world is a natural fit for crypto, which *gives physical-like characteristics to digital things.* Humans are spatially oriented, and a metaverse can make abstract concepts like digital ownership feel tangible and real.

-----

### üñºÔ∏è NFTs: The Most Tangible Form of Crypto

  * NFTs are incredibly exciting because they are the most **tangible** part of the crypto world. You own a specific, unique *item*.
  * **NFTs as Social Networks:**
      * Owning an NFT is a ticket into a community. It‚Äôs a cultural signifier.
      * You can be a **Degen Ape** and a member of the **Monkey Business** community at the same time, holding multiple digital identities.
  * **The Creative Evolution:**
      * **Now:** Low-fidelity 2D art. The technical constraints serve as a **forcing function on creativity.**
      * **Future:** Full-scale, high-production 3D models and interactive experiences.
  * **Bridging the Physical and Digital:**
      * Imagine a 3D model of a real-world building, designed in professional software, being minted as an NFT.
      * You could then own the digital rights to the Chrysler Building and place it in your personal corner of the metaverse.
