## 🚀 Early Tech Journey & Founding Dig  
- **2004 Leap of Faith** ➡ Quit job at TechTV to launch *Digg*  
- Inspiration: *Slashdot* — but open submissions & community voting  
- Early AJAX adoption for seamless upvotes/downvotes ⚡  
- First large-scale social news platform → millions of monthly uniques  
- Competed heavily with Reddit until their *subreddit* innovation  

---

## 🎯 Lessons from Digg’s Rise & Fall

- Misstep: Over-expanding taxonomy (politics section) → polarization  
- Harsh reality: Threats during U.S. elections → FBI involvement  
- Key takeaway: **Social networks can become powerful, even dangerous tools**

## 🎮 Gaming Roots & Digital Economies  
- Early fascination with *Ultima Online* & *EverQuest* 🌍  
- Persistent virtual worlds naturally develop economies  
- NFTs = evolution of in-game assets with *permanent, portable ownership*  
- Use cases:  
  - Cross-world asset transfer  
  - Virtual land ownership  
  - Player-driven economies  
- **Metaverse potential:** user-generated worlds leveraging existing NFT ecosystems

## 🎨 NFTs: Art, Provenance & Utility  
- *CryptoPunks* (ERC-721 pioneers) as **digital historical artifacts**  
- Personal rare asset: **Zombie Punk** (only 88 exist) 🧟  
- Other notable platforms: **Art Blocks** (generative, on-chain art)  
- Emerging creative possibilities:  
  - *Dynamic NFTs*: art that morphs over time via on-chain logic  
  - RSA Time-Locks for timed reveals

## 📦 NFT Technical Example — Time-Locked Content
```solidity
// Simplified Solidity snippet for NFT time-based reveal
function reveal(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (string memory) {
    require(block.timestamp >= revealTimestamps[_tokenId], "Not yet revealed");
    return tokenMetadata[_tokenId];
}
```
- Could integrate **zk-Proofs** for hidden attributes until reveal date

## 📈 Investment & Venture Approach  
1. **Long-term focus**: Multi-year lockups welcomed (5–7 years)  
2. **Two-pronged strategy**:  
   - Direct token holdings in promising protocols  
   - Seed-stage equity/token investments pre-code  
3. Filter: *Orders of magnitude growth potential* over 5+ years  
4. Avoid “indexing” crypto indiscriminately — many top-market-cap assets are stagnant or abandoned  

---

## 🛡 Risks & Education Goals  
- *DeFi complexity*: high barrier to mainstream user onboarding  
- Example: Multi-hop swaps on DEXs (e.g., via **1inch**, **Serum**) intimidating for newcomers  
- Aim: Build comfort via small-scale experimentation (e.g., $50 test funds)  
- Encourage learning *why* DeFi matters → transparency, composability, global access  

---

## ⚙ Blockchain Gaming & Revenue Models  
- **Indie studios** poised to benefit from open standards faster than AAA studios  
- Potential:  
  - Players own & trade earned assets  
  - User-created game levels as monetizable NFTs  
- Economic loop: play → earn → trade → reinvest in-game or cash out  

---

## 🖼 NFT Integration in Physical & Virtual Spaces  
- Display tech to watch:  
  - Infinite Objects frames for looping digital art  
  - AR overlays tied to token IDs  
- Future: walk into venue ➡ scan QR ➡ acquire on-chain limited edition art instantly
