## Project Overviews

### Audius
> *"Audius is a decentralized audio hosting and streaming protocol. We help artists connect directly with fans and distribute any music they want in a Community First and community-owned way."*

- Launched in September 2019
- Recently crossed *1 million monthly users*
- Migrating a large piece of the system to Solana for scalability

### MEME
> *"It's Community First, it's meme first. Within 10 days of the inception of this community and token distribution, we launched our first product on mainnet."*

- Originated from a satirical tweet that evolved into a community
- Pioneered the concept of *NFT mining* or *NFT farming*
- Users lock up assets to earn exclusive limited edition NFTs
- Creating a platform where artists engage with community rather than just selling to whales

## The Value of NFTs

### Digital Ownership and Scarcity
> *"This idea that humans now have access to cryptography and can do all these things with cryptography alone is incredibly transformative."*

- NFTs implement concepts of copyright law and art ownership
- Enable *provable ownership* and *provable scarcity* of digital content
- Bridge to mass adoption from Web2 to Web3
- Tap into fundamental human needs for ownership and status

### Community Engagement
> *"The thing I'm really excited about is figuring out how to use NFTs to make things more engaging. There's fundamental value of scarcity enabling creators to use that scarcity to engage their customer base."*

- Transform traditionally "single player" applications into "multiplayer" experiences
- Create deeper connections between artists and fans
- Provide tools for community engagement and monetization

## NFT Use Cases

### Music Industry Applications
- *Fan clubs and exclusive content*: NFTs can represent membership or exclusive access
- *Monetization*: Artists can sell limited edition works directly to fans
- *Rights management*: Attach royalty streams or listening rights to NFT ownership
- *Remix culture*: Enable legal sharing and remixing of content with proper attribution

### Art and Collectibles
- *Digital art ownership*: Provable ownership of unique digital pieces
- *Programmable art*: Art that can change or evolve based on certain conditions
- *Curation and discovery*: Platforms for artists to showcase work

### Gaming and Achievements
- *Non-transferable achievements*: NFTs as proof of accomplishments that can't be transferred
- *In-game assets*: True ownership of digital items within games

## Challenges in the NFT Space

### Fraud and Verification
> *"The really interesting thing is blockchain guarantees on the back end like no double spending and scarcity, but humans don't interact with cryptographic things on a blockchain. Humans interact with the screen, and the screen can say anything."*

- Fake NFTs being uploaded to marketplaces
- Need for verification systems and authentic seals
- Challenge of establishing trust in digital ownership
- Potential solutions:
  - Verified identities for creators
  - Reverse image/audio search to find first instances
  - Timestamping to prove existence of content at a certain time

### User Experience
- Difficulty in managing keys and passwords
- Balancing decentralization with usability
- Making complex crypto concepts accessible to mainstream users

## The Future of NFTs

### Curation and Discovery
> *"How do we scale curation of culture effectively? Either we begin to silo things or scarcity of the curation space becomes a feature rather than an issue."*

- Emergence of curator communities and DAOs
- Balancing centralized curation with community-driven discovery
- Potential for gamification of curation processes
- Creating platforms that allow creators to submit work and let the market decide

### Identity and Digital Platforms
> *"I believe the next platform is the elliptical curve space. It doesn't matter if it's Mobile, Web, Internet, Solana, Ethereum, or some Layer 2. What we're communicating with is these elliptical curves."*

- Cryptographic keys as fundamental identity
- Moving beyond platform-specific identities
- Integration of various protocols into a global digital experience

### Artist Empowerment
> *"Equalizing and removing the middleman is a way to enable more artists to succeed."*

- Direct connection between artists and fans
- New monetization models beyond traditional intermediaries
- Lowering barriers to entry for creators
- Enabling more sustainable careers for artists
