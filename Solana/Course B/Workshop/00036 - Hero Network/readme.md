### 🚀 **Foundational Journey: From Trading Floors to Crypto Innovation**

- **Dan Gunsberg’s background** is deeply rooted in traditional financial markets:
  - Began career on the **floor of the Chicago Board of Trade** at age 18.
  - Traded **US Treasury bonds**, then transitioned into **tech stock trading** during the internet boom.
  - Later returned to **Futures markets**, focusing on the short end of the yield curve.
  - Served as **Chief Operating Officer** at a proprietary trading firm.

- **Entry into crypto (2015)**:
  - Bitcoin’s recovery from the bear market sparked interest.
  - Recognized **asymmetric upside optionality** — small capital risk, large potential reward.
  - By **2017**, fully immersed in the crypto ecosystem.
  - In **2018**, co-founded **Hero Network** with a former colleague from the same trading firm.

> 💡 *“Crypto is unstoppable because it’s just code.”*

### 🔄 **The Problem: Retail Traders & the Risks of Over-Leverage**

- Observed a troubling trend in **2017–2018**:
  - New retail traders flocking to platforms like **BitMEX**.
  - High **leverage**, low experience → rapid capital loss.
  - Emotional trading amplified by lack of education and risk controls.

- Key insight:
  - Traditional derivatives are complex and intimidating.
  - Missing **emotional, social, and gamified elements** that could make trading more engaging and less destructive.

> 🧠 *“Can we balance financial reward with emotional engagement?”*

### 🌐 **Hero Network: A New Paradigm for Derivatives**

Hero Network began as **Hero.io**, a centralized platform offering simplified crypto derivatives. It has since evolved into a **progressively decentralized network**.

#### 🎯 Core Philosophy
- **Simplify** complex financial instruments.
- **Democratize** access to derivatives.
- **Gamify** trading to reduce emotional volatility.
- **Decentralize** ownership and governance.

#### 🛠️ Products on Hero.io (Pre-Decentralization)
1. **Moon wct**  
   - A **cash-or-nothing digital option** with a **paramutualized payoff**.
   - Outcome: Binary (e.g., “Will BTC be above $60K in 24h?”).
   - Payouts are **not fixed** — they depend on the total pool distribution (more on this below).

2. **OneTouch Options**  
   - Pays out if price touches a predefined level within a time window.
   - Ideal for volatile assets.

3. **Light Exotic Options**  
   - Simplified versions of vanilla options with unique payoff structures.
   - Designed for ease of use and low barrier to entry.

> 📌 *Paramutual = A hybrid between a mutual and a parametric insurance model. Payouts are determined algorithmically based on participation and outcome.*

### 🔗 **Progressive Decentralization: Building a Network, Not Just a Platform**

Hero Network is transitioning from a **centralized service** to a **decentralized protocol layer** on **Solana**.

#### 📈 Why Decentralize?
- Avoid **regulatory friction** with B2B white-labeling.
- Enable **permissionless innovation** by third-party operators.
- Align incentives via **tokenomics and community ownership**.

#### 🏗️ Key Goals
- Create **modular derivative protocols**.
- Allow **any operator** to plug into the network.
- Enable **non-custodial, web3-native access** for users.

> 🔁 *“We want to become irrelevant. The network should outgrow us.”*

- Users interact **non-custodially** — no need to trust a central entity.

---

### 💡 **Innovation: Smart Automated Market Maker (SAM)**

Traditional AMMs (like Uniswap) use **constant product formulas** (x * y = k), which can be inefficient for binary or options-based markets.

Hero introduces **SAM** — **Smart Automated Market Maker**.

#### 🧠 How SAM Works
- Combines **liquidity pools** with **probability oracles**.
- Oracle provides **real-time probabilistic forecasts** for binary outcomes.
- SAM uses this data to **optimize LP positions** and reduce impermanent loss.

#### 🔮 Probability Oracle
- Run by specialized teams called **Probability Nodes**.
- Before a market opens, nodes submit:
  - Forecasted outcome probability.
  - Optimal liquidity position (long/short bias).
- Nodes are **incentivized** via a share of transaction fees.

> 📊 *Example: A node predicts 60% chance BTC > $60K in 24h → suggests LP take a short bias.*

#### 💰 Incentive Structure
1. Node submits forecast + position.
2. Oracle aggregates inputs.
3. SAM adjusts LP position accordingly.
4. Fees distributed to nodes based on accuracy and participation.

```rust
// Pseudocode: SAM Oracle Interaction (Solana Program)
pub fn submit_forecast(
    node: Pubkey,
    market_id: u64,
    probability: u8, // 0-100%
    position_bias: i32, // -100 to +100 (short/long)
) -> ProgramResult {
    // Validate node is registered
    // Store forecast in on-chain account
    // Weight by node reputation/stake
    // Update SAM strategy pre-market open
    Ok(())
}
```

### 🌱 **Paramutual Mechanics: How Payouts Work**

Unlike fixed-payout options, **paramutual** markets adjust payouts based on participation.

#### 📋 Example: Moon wct Market
- **Question**: Will SOL be > $100 in 7 days?
- **Two sides**: “Yes” and “No”.
- Total pool: 100,000 $HERO.
  - “Yes” side: 70,000 $HERO.
  - “No” side: 30,000 $HERO.

#### ✅ Outcome: SOL > $100
- “Yes” side wins.
- Payout per unit = Total “No” pool / Total “Yes” pool
  - = 30,000 / 70,000 ≈ **0.428 $HERO per 1 $HERO staked**
- “No” side loses entire stake.

> 🔄 *Payouts are dynamic — early participants on the minority side get higher returns.*

#### 📉 Why This Works
- Encourages **early participation**.
- Balances pools via **natural market incentives**.
- Reduces need for external underwriting.

### 🌐 **Community Capitalism: The New Economic Model**

Hero embraces **Community Capitalism** — a shift from shareholder to community-driven value.

#### 📅 Era Shifts in Capitalism
1. **2000–2010**: Shareholder Capitalism  
   - Maximize profits for investors.
2. **2010–2020**: Consumer Capitalism  
   - Win users, monetize attention.
3. **2020+**: **Community Capitalism**  
   - Value is co-created and shared with participants.

> 🤝 *“We’re not building a SaaS. We’re building a community-owned network.”*

#### 🧬 Kibbutz Analogy
- Inspired by **Israeli kibbutzim** — collective, self-governed communities.
- Members contribute labor, share resources, govern collectively.
- Hero Network aims to replicate this digitally:
  - **Developers** = Engineers maintaining the system.
  - **Liquidity Providers** = Farmers tending the fields.
  - **Traders** = Participants using the ecosystem.
  - **Token Holders** = Citizens voting on governance.

> 🌾 *“We’re building the pipes so the kibbutz can have water.”*
