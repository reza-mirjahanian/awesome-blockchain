### 🧩 Core Concepts: Composability & Layer 1s

* **Composability is King** 👑
    * *This is the core value proposition of DeFi, where protocols act like "money legos" that can be combined to create new financial products.*
* **The Layer 1 Dilemma** 🤔
    * Ethereum's strong **network effects** make it dominant, even though it's slow. All the "money legos" are in one place.
* **Fractured Future?** Fragmentation of liquidity across different Layer 1s and Layer 2s is a major risk, as it breaks composability.
    * *Sam Bankman-Fried noted that Layer 2s are "terrible" for composability because they fracture the ecosystem.*
* **Multi-Chain Specialization** ⛓️
    * A potential future is that different chains will specialize. For example, using Solana for high-frequency trading while using Ethereum for final settlement and deep liquidity.

### 🗳️ Governance & Security

* **A "Thing Worth Governing"**
    * *SBF emphasized that a protocol must first have real utility and users. Only then does its governance become meaningful and valuable.*
* **Governance Participation** 📊
    * Voter turnout is often low for routine updates but spikes dramatically for **contentious issues** where different user groups have conflicting interests.
* **Governance Attacks** ⚔️
    * This is a significant risk where an attacker could borrow or buy enough tokens to pass a malicious vote.
* **Defense Mechanisms** 🛡️
    * **Time-locks:** *Proposals have a built-in delay before execution, giving users time to exit if the vote is malicious.*
    * **Vote-locking:** *Requiring users to lock tokens for a set period to vote (like on Curve) ensures they have a long-term stake in the protocol's health.*
    * **Liquid Democracy:** *A system where you can delegate your vote to an expert or trusted party, but can still override their vote at any time.*

### 🚀 The Future of DeFi

* **Staking Derivatives**
    * *These are liquid tokens that represent assets staked in a Proof-of-Stake network. They are seen as a massive growth area to unlock capital, similar to how miner financing drove the early Bitcoin ecosystem.*
* **Massive Scaling Needed** 📈
    * SBF believes DeFi needs a **1,000,000x increase in throughput** to truly reach mass adoption and support billions of users.
* **Privacy is Key** 🤫
    * Tarun Chitra highlighted that significant improvements in **privacy**, likely through **zero-knowledge proofs**, are critical to onboarding traditional financial institutions.
* **TradFi as a Frontend** 🏦
    * The panelists predict that in the future, traditional banks won't compete with DeFi but will instead act as user-friendly **front-ends** to DeFi protocols, leveraging their brands to bring in mainstream users.
