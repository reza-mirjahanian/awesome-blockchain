# Fireside Chat with Robert Leshner: Building Compound and the Future of DeFi

## 🚀 Robert's Journey into Crypto

Robert Leshner's path to founding Compound represents a unique blend of **traditional finance expertise** and **entrepreneurial spirit**:

### Background & Early Career
- Started in **traditional finance** working in interest rate markets
- Combined finance knowledge with builder mentality
- Moved to California to become a venture-backed software founder
- Remained a crypto hobbyist:
  - Explored Bitcoin early on
  - Did some mining in 2013
  - Stayed on the sidelines until Ethereum

### The Ethereum "Aha" Moment 💡

> "When Ethereum came out, it was sort of an aha moment for me because I said oh you can actually **program assets and value** now"

**Key realization**: Unlike Bitcoin (just a new currency), Ethereum offered:
- Turing-complete programming platform
- Ability to route logic, assets, and wealth on blockchain
- Programmable financial markets

## 🏗️ Building Compound: From Zero to $2.5 Billion

### The Genesis (2017)
- **Pre-DeFi era**: The term "DeFi" didn't even exist yet
- **Core vision**: Create interest rate markets for crypto assets
- **Initial uncertainty**: "When we started we had no idea if it would even work"
- **Pioneering approach**: Building entirely new financial markets as executable, autonomous code

### Evolution of Design Philosophy

1. **Initial approach**: Build everything (market + application + mobile app)
2. **Key insight**: Focus on one thing extremely well
   - Just create an interest rate market
   - Make it accessible to other developers
   - Let others build interfaces and applications

> "The open nature of building on a blockchain means that we can just focus on like one specific piece"

### Learning Phase (First 6-12 Months)
- **Research & Discovery**: Understanding blockchain nuances
- **No existing patterns**: Had to invent everything from scratch
- **Common patterns emerged later** (2020+):
  - Pools of assets
  - Indices to track value
  - Shortcuts for handling thousands of users

## 🔄 Compound's Evolution: Three Versions

### Version 0: R&D Phase
- Never released publicly
- Pure experimentation

### Version 1: Monolithic Smart Contract
- Simple functionality:
  - Put token into the box
  - Borrow token from the box
- Basic but functional

### Version 2: The Game Changer 🎮
**Revolutionary feature**: Tokenized balances

- When you supply assets, you receive a token representing your balance
- These tokens are:
  - **Transferable**
  - **Tradeable**
  - **Programmable**
  - **Cold storage compatible**

> "If you have a bank account at JP Morgan, you can't program your balance... but being able to let any developer move the balances inside Compound... was one of the massive inflection points"

## 🧩 The Unix Philosophy in DeFi

### Token In, Token Out Paradigm
- **Core principle**: Every protocol interaction should be reversible
- **Analogy**: Like Unix programs operating through pipes
- **Benefits**:
  - Robust accounting systems
  - Specific risk management
  - Composability

### Standards vs. Innovation
- Didn't have to be token standards
- Could have been alternative functions (move, transfer balances)
- Market converged on tokens as the interface
- **Key insight**: "Software flattens all roads"

## ⚡ DeFi vs Traditional Finance

### Traditional FinTech Limitations
1. **Narrow innovations**: Small, incremental improvements
2. **Permission required**: Must partner with incumbents
3. **Slow process**: Years to get to market
4. **Linear progress**: Lightly sloped improvement curve

### DeFi Advantages
1. **No permission needed**: Build and deploy immediately
2. **Rapid deployment**: Days, not years
3. **Major innovations**: Complete reinventions, not tiny improvements
4. **Exponential growth**: Hockey stick adoption curve

> "The pace of progress in DeFi is just clearly exponential and the pace of progress in FinTech is extremely linear"

## ⚠️ The Risk Stack: Understanding Composability Dangers

### Low-Level vs High-Level Systems

**Low-Level Financial Primitives** (like Compound):
- Minimal dependencies
- Proven through audits and time
- Risk is very low (but never zero)
- Unaffected by other system failures

**High-Level Financial Products**:
- Compose multiple protocols
- **Risk multiplication**:
  - 1 level up = ~9x risk
  - 2 levels up = ~100x risk
  - Each hop = 10x risk multiplier

### The Harvest Finance Example
> "People are like 'why would I want 4% in Compound when I can get 6% in this thing up here' and you're like 'oh my goodness buyer beware'... you're taking 100,000 times the risk"

### Market Education Challenge
- Users don't yet understand risk stratification
- Market needs to develop risk assessment culture
- Self-regulation through hard lessons
- Eventually: "Where does that return come from?"

## 🤖 The Future: AI and Machine-Operated Finance

### Traditional Finance Limitations
- Runs on **spreadsheets and contracts**
- Extremely hard to machine-operate
- Inherently inefficient

### Blockchain Advantages
- **Open systems** fully accessible to machines
- **Computer programs** deployed on blockchain
- Ideal for AI/ML oversight and calibration
- Enables true automation

### The Vision
> "I kind of saw these systems as like the only place where true general purpose AI could form is inside one of these chains... we might be building infrastructure that's just more fundamentally ideal for more rapid Evolution"

## 🌉 Cross-Chain Philosophy

### Compound's Multi-Chain Approach
- **Ethereum fit**: Works well despite high cost and slower speed
  - 45-second borrowing time is acceptable
  - Less need for speed than trading systems
- **Chain agnostic**: All smart contract platforms are "fungible block space"
- **Bridge-enabled**: Assets can move between chains as needed

### The Future Web of Chains
1. Natural evolution of bridges between chains
2. Ethereum for secure base settlement
3. Fast chains (like Solana) for trading
4. Risk management potentially on separate systems
5. Liquidity and collateralization based on user preferences

### Innovation Areas
- **AMM space**: Hot area for development
- **Hybrid models**: Leveraging different chain strengths
- **Cross-chain RPC confirmations**: For risk management
- **Sophisticated hedging**: Across multiple chains
