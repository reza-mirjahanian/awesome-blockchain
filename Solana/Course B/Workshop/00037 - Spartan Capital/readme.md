## 🐻 Surviving the 2018 Bear Market  
- *Eating glass* for two years: depths of the bear market  
- Fears crypto might vanish after 2017 excesses  
- Founders who **kept building** set the stage for 2020–2021  
  - Synthetix pivoted from stablecoin (Haven) to **synthetic derivatives**  
  - Ethlend → AAVE transitioned into liquidity-driven lending  

---

## 📊 From Fundamentals Hedge Fund to VC  
1. Fundamentals Hedge Fund  
   - Focus on **Revenue**, **User KPIs**, **TVL**  
   - Data-driven decisions  
2. Adventure Fund (Venture)  
   - Invests earlier, with *less data*  
   - Requires deeper **conviction** in Founders  
   - Hands-on support across time zones 🤝

## 🛠 DeFi Case Study: MakerDAO  
- Early leader in TVL and protocol usage  
- Stability fee = *recurring revenue* → token burns  
- Discounted Cash Flow model (pseudocode):

```python
# DCF for Maker Stability Fees
burn_rate = stability_fee * circulating_supply
cash_flows = [burn_rate * (1 + growth_rate)**year for year in range(1,6)]
npv = sum(cf / (1 + discount_rate)**year for year, cf in enumerate(cash_flows,1))
```

- Key signals:  
  - 50% of users on Chinese UI 🇨🇳  
  - Global demand for **trustless leverage**

## 🌊 Waves of Crypto Adoption  
1. **Speculators & Degens** bootstrapping liquidity

## 🔗 Vertical Integration & Moats  
- Aggregator → AMM → Lending  
  - 0x → Matcha; 1inch → AMM & lending  
- **Three moat sources**:  
  - Integrations across protocols  
  - Security & Lindy effect  
  - Speed of innovation vs audit cycles ⚡️  

---

## 🛡 Security & Bug Bounty Challenges  
- Typical bounty: \$100 K  
- Exploit value: \$100 M+  
- Incentive mismatch → hackers prefer exploits  
- Long-term solution still pending 🔍  

---

## 💰 Yield Farming: Boom & Bust  
- APYs often **annualized illusions**  
- Market-cycle dynamics:  
  - Bull → *skyrocketing yields*  
  - Bear → *yield collapse* (Sep 2020 crash)  
- Sustainable only when token value and TVL hold up

## 🔮 Next Frontiers & Related Concepts  
- **Audio tokens** (e.g., Audius) linking artists ↔ fans 🎧  
- **Cross-chain composability** (Thorchain, Wormhole) 🌉  
- Emerging primitives:  
  1. Privacy protocols (zkSNARKs) 🔒  
  2. On-chain identity & reputation 🆔  
  3. Real-world asset tokenization 🌐
