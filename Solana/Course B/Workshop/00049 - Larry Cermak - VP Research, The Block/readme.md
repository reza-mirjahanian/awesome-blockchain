# 🎙️ From Skeptic to Shitcoiner: A Crypto Journey  
*(a.k.a. “How to change your mind in four years”)*
---

## 1️⃣ 2016–2017: Genesis  
- **Late-2016** – *undergrad thesis on Bitcoin*  
  - Motivation: make thesis “not boring” 📚  
  - Discovered **research vacuum**:  
    - 🐂 super-bulls + 🐻 super-bears = zero middle-ground  
- **Early-2017** – joined *crypto-only research shop*  
  - Focus on **data-driven fundamentals** (novel at the time)  
  - Warned against **ICO mania** ⚠️  
  - **No-coiner phase**: held zero crypto, thought it was “hype mania”  

---

## 2️⃣ 2018–2020: Mind-Flip  
- **Late-2018** – co-founded The Block research desk (2 → 25 researchers)  
- **DeFi Summer 2020** – *aha moment*  
  - Tokens ≠ useless; they can:  
    1. **Bootstrap liquidity**  
    2. **Align incentives**  
    3. **Approximate equity** via cash-flow claims + governance 🗳️  
  - Started seed investing & allocating personally

## 3️⃣ 🪙 Bitcoin: The Ultimate Meme  
- **Value driver** = *shared belief*, not cash-flow  
- **Gold analogy**  
  - Jewelry/industrial use ~ negligible  
  - Price = *scarcity meme* + *store-of-value meme*  
- **Institutional bid**  
  - Tesla, hedge funds, treasuries 🏦  
  - Post-Tesla-announce → research inquiries 📈  
- **Research reality**  
  - Very little to model apart from **hash-rate / mining**  
  - Most reports = “explain Bitcoin to institutions”  

---

## 4️⃣ 🧪 DeFi & Shitcoins  
### 4.1  What Gives a Token Value?  
- **Community + meme strength** 🧑‍🤝‍🧑  
- **Developer mindshare** 👩‍💻  
- **Liquidity depth** 🌊  
- **Composability** 🧩  
- *Not* necessarily cash-flow (most “revenue” goes to LPs, not token)  

### 4.2  SushiSwap Mini-Case  
- **Thesis**: bet that *devs + community* keep shipping  
- **Value levers**  
  - Ongoing NFT marketplace build  
  - Launchpad fees  
  - *Real* cash-flows still < emissions (negative net margin)

## 5️⃣ 🔮 Regulation & Decentralization  
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| SEC labels governance tokens securities | High | Medium-High | Pseudonymous teams 🥷 |
| Stable-coin crackdown | High | High | Shift to ETH/SOL as units of account |
| Geoblocking of front ends | Near-certain | Medium | Alternative UIs, IPFS, direct contract calls |

- **Prediction**: *“Within 12-18 mo the SEC drops a framework”*  
- **Developer playbook**  
  1. Deploy immutable contracts  
  2. Go pseudonymous  
  3. Decentralize front-end & governance early  

---

## 6️⃣ 🌐 Crypto as Public Good  
- **Permissionless access** 🌍  
  - Paying Kenyan researcher in stables when banking rails failed  
- **Composability** 🧪  
  - Legos = rapid innovation cycles  
- **Longevity**  
  - *“Can’t imagine a world in 3 yrs where crypto is ‘gone’”*

## 7️⃣ 🧮 Valuation Framework Cheat-Sheet
```
Network_Value = f (
    N_active_users,
    avg_tx_fee * tx_volume,
    community_strength_score,
    meme_coefficient,
    regulation_discount
)
```
- **Social indicators** trump DCF in early stage  
- **Attention arbitrage** > “fundamental” arbitrage  

---

## 8️⃣ 🎨 NFTs & Culture-Backed Money  
- **Luxury spending shift** 🏎️➡️🖼️  
  - Lower carbon, zero physical storage  
- **NFT floor = collateral thesis**  
  - Internet money backed by culture, not BTC/ETH  
- **Crypto-kitties → Punks → Art Blocks**  
  - Same dynamic as Bitcoin “original NFT”

## 9️⃣ 🧑‍💻 Developer Quick-Start Kit  
### 9.1  Bootstrapping Liquidity (Solidity snippet)
```solidity
// Minimal liquidity-mining contract
contract LiquidityMine {
    IERC20 public rewardToken;
    IERC20 public stakeToken;
    uint public rewardRate;

    mapping(address => uint) public stakes;
    mapping(address => uint) public lastUpdate;

    modifier update(address user) {
        uint timeDelta = block.timestamp - lastUpdate[user];
        uint earned = stakes[user] * rewardRate * timeDelta;
        rewardToken.transfer(user, earned);
        lastUpdate[user] = block.timestamp;
        _;
    }

    function stake(uint amount) external update(msg.sender) {
        stakeToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        stakes[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) external update(msg.sender) {
        stakes[msg.sender] -= amount;
        stakeToken.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}
```

### 9.2  Decentralized Front-End Checklist  
- ✅ Host on IPFS / Arweave  
- ✅ ENS domain  
- ✅ No central API keys  
- ✅ Open-source build pipeline (GitHub Actions → IPFS pin)
