The Turbine protocol is a block propagation mechanism used by Solana to efficiently broadcast ledger entries to all nodes in the network. Inspired by BitTorrent, Turbine breaks down blocks into smaller pieces and disseminates them through a hierarchy of nodes, reducing the communication overhead and ensuring fast, secure, and decentralized transactions2. This allows Solana to handle tens of thousands of transactions per second while maintaining network performance and security.
