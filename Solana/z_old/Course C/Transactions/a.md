Below are key details about how transactions are executed:

-   Execution Order: If a transaction includes multiple instructions, the instructions are processed in the order they are added to the transaction.
-   Atomicity: A transaction is atomic, meaning it either fully completes with all instructions successfully processed, or fails altogether. If any instruction within the transaction fails, none of the instructions are executed.

Key PointsÂ [#](https://solana.com/docs/core/transactions#key-points)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Solana transactions consist of instructions that interact with various programs on the network, where each instruction represents a specific operation.

-   Each instruction specifies the program to execute the instruction, the accounts required by the instruction, and the data required for the instruction's execution.

-   Instructions within a transaction are processed in the order they are listed.

-   Transactions are atomic, meaning either all instructions process successfully, or the entire transaction fails.

-   The maximum size of a transaction is 1232 bytes.
