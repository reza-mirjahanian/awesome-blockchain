Introduction to Solana
----------------------

-   Created by **Anatoly Yakovenko**, former Qualcomm engineer
-   Named after Solana Beach
-   Known for:
    -   Extremely fast block times (400 milliseconds)
    -   High transaction capacity (theoretically up to 710,000 TPS)
    -   Low transaction fees (around 1/100th of a penny)

Unique Technological Features
-----------------------------

### 1\. Proof of History (PoH)

-   Not a consensus mechanism, but a way to integrate time into blockchain data
-   Allows for fast sequencing of validators without constant communication
-   Solves the problem of agreeing on time in a distributed network

### 2\. Parallel Smart Contract Execution (Sea Level)

-   Allows multiple smart contracts to run simultaneously
-   Increases efficiency compared to serial execution in other blockchains

### 3\. Hardware-Driven Scaling

-   Solana's capacity increases with improvements in hardware (e.g., NVIDIA GPUs)

### 4\. Rust-Based Smart Contracts

-   Uses Rust programming language instead of Solidity
-   More powerful but requires more development effort
-   Not directly compatible with Ethereum dApps

Consensus and Validation
------------------------

-   Combines Proof of Stake with Proof of History
-   No minimum requirement to become a validator
-   Daily voting fee for validators (currently about 1 SOL)

Tokenomics of SOL
-----------------

-   **Used for:** Transaction fees and throughout the ecosystem
-   **Supply:** Initially 500 million tokens, inflationary
-   **Deflationary aspect:** 50% of transaction fees are burned
-   **Inflationary aspect:** Staking rewards (currently ~8%, decreasing over time)

### Token Distribution

-   36% sold in private funding rounds and ICO
-   13% to founders
-   10% to Solana Foundation
-   39% for community initiatives

Notable Events and Concerns
---------------------------

-   **Network Outage:** Experienced a 6-hour downtime in December 2020
-   **Development Stage:** Still in beta, which may pose risks
