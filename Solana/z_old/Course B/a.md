### **Cost Efficiency and Scalability**

-   **Cost reduction**: Solana has seen **costs drop by a factor of 10,000** compared to Ethereum and Layer 2 solutions.
    -   Example: Minting 50 million NFTs on Solana costs **$1,000**, while on Ethereum or Layer 2s it would cost **hundreds of thousands of dollars**.
-   **Transaction capacity**: Solana handles more **transactions per day from applications alone** than Ethereum and all Layer 2s combined.
-   **Scalability**: Solana can scale to **millions of transactions per second (TPS)** using modern hardware, without requiring changes to the protocol.

### **Unique Architecture: Composability and No Layers**

-   **No layers**: Unlike Ethereum, Solana does not separate its environment into layers, preserving **composability**.
    -   **Composability**: All applications interact within a **single global state machine**, akin to running on one world computer.
    -   Example: A user can trade **20 cents across five different companies** in milliseconds for a fraction of a penny, something impossible in traditional finance or Ethereum's Layer 2s.

### **Hardware and Network Evolution**

-   **Hardware advancements**: As hardware improves, it becomes cheaper to run the Solana network.
    -   Server costs have dropped from **$1,100** to **$350 per month**, with predictions of falling below **$200**.
    -   **Google Fiber** offering **20 gigabit networks** to homes shows that Solana's reliance on data centers is diminishing.
-   **Software and hardware synergy**: Solana's network is designed to improve as hardware advances, reducing the need for further scalability work.

### **Fire Dancer: Redundancy and Reliability**

-   **Fire Dancer** is a second implementation of the Solana protocol, similar to Ethereum's multiple client implementations.
    -   **Redundancy**: Having multiple implementations reduces the risk of a **single point of failure**, enhancing **decentralization**.
    -   The probability of two teams implementing the same bug is **virtually zero**, improving network reliability.

### **Real-World Use Cases: Helium**

-   **Helium**: A use case where Solana enables a **$5 data plan** in Miami, with plans to expand nationwide.
    -   Helium uses **compressed NFTs** to represent hotspots and manage payments for 5G services.
    -   USDC transfers and Helium data plans operate on the same blockchain, demonstrating the power of Solana's **frictionless composability**.

### **Compressed NFTs and New Business Models**

-   **Compressed NFTs**: A new model where NFT metadata is stored off-chain using **Merkle trees**, drastically reducing costs.
    -   Example: **Drip House** minted **50 million NFTs** for $1,000, creating a subscription-based model where users receive NFTs from creators.
    -   **Cost comparison**: Minting the same number of NFTs on Ethereum or Layer 2s would cost **hundreds of thousands of dollars**.

### **Smart Wallets and Improved User Experience**

-   **Multisig wallets**: Solana supports **formally verified multisig wallets** that act as smart contracts, eliminating the need for seed phrases.
    -   Users can set up wallets using **multiple devices**, providing redundancy in case a device is lost.
    -   This shift moves away from the traditional **"write down your seed phrase"** model, improving user experience.
    -   **Example**: Users can set up a wallet using their computer, phone, and iCloud account without needing a seed phrase.

### **The Future of Decentralized Finance**

-   **Decentralized finance**: Solana's technology is already capable of supporting **all of finance on decentralized rails**.
    -   The main challenge now is **adoption**, finding **use cases**, and achieving **product-market fit**.
    -   Solana has **solved the technical bottlenecks**, and now it's about **real-world applications** catching up.
