# **SIMD 180: Leader Schedule Migration**  
- **Proposed by**: Justin Star (Anza)  
- **Objective**: Shift leader schedule selection from **node ID** to **stake account/vote pubkey**.  
- **Benefits**:  
  - Simplifies codebase.  
  - Enables future **slashing implementations** (e.g., penalizing validators for double-block production).  
- **Related Commits**:  
  - Adjusts banking stage calculations to use **vote account** instead of node pubkey.  
  - Aligns reward distribution logic post-epoch.

# **Key Code Commits**  
1. **Support Complete Slot Status in Geyser**:  
   - **Geyser Plugin Update**: Allows subscribing to **completed slots** via Geyser plugins.  
   - Use cases: Custom alerts, websocket triggers, or data processing after slot finalization.  

2. **Leader Window Packet Wait Time Reduction**:  
   - **Commit by KV**: Reduces idle wait time for packets during leader window from **100ms → 10ms**.  
   - Impact: Improves block production efficiency by minimizing idle time.  

3. **Standalone SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) Example**:  
   - **Added by Anza Team**: Demonstrates how to build a custom JSON-RPC service using SVM.  
   - Includes:  
     - Client/server implementation.  
     - On-chain program execution.  
     - Custom transaction simulation.  
   - Purpose: Enables developers to create **SVM-compatible tools/apps**.

# **Assembly Programming on Solana**  
- **Advocate**: Dean (founder of **Compiler Disrespects** movement).  
- **Features**:  
  - Directly write on-chain programs in **assembly**.  
  - Ultra-low deployment cost (e.g., **4 CUs** for a counter program vs. 1.8M CUs for Anchor).  
  - Minimal overhead: No frameworks, raw byte manipulation.  
- **Use Cases**:  
  - High-performance primitives (e.g., balance checks).  
  - Extreme optimization for specific tasks.  
- **Resources**:  
  - Tutorials and examples (e.g., counter program) on Solana Docs.  
  - Repositories with **C**, **Zig**, and **Rust** optimization examples.

# **Community Contributions**  
1. **Alandro’s Quinn Protocol Improvements**:  
   - **Achievement**: Scaled Solana’s QUIC implementation to **500,000 TPS**.  
   - **Impact**: Contributions upstreamed to **Quinn** (open-source QUIC library), benefiting broader ecosystem.  

2. **Stack Exchange Activity**:  
   - Top contributors: Jimmy, Shala, Dylan, Defor, BlackHorse, RX.  
   - Focus: Improving developer resources and troubleshooting guides.
