## **Introduction**
- **Event**: Solana Change Log  
- **Hosts**: Nick (Solana Foundation Dev Team) and Jonas  
- **Topics**: Updates on Solana blockchain, Agave 2.0, feature activations, developer tools, and ecosystem improvements.

## **Mainnet Updates**
### **Agave 2.0**
- **Status**:  
  - Live on **mainnet** with over 95-96% of stake adoption.  
  - Faster performance compared to version 1.18.  
  - Validators on 1.18 experienced delays and were forced to upgrade earlier than planned.  

- **Deprecated IPC Calls**:  
  - Calls like `getRecentBlockhash` are no longer supported.  
  - **Action**: Developers must update their code to use the latest APIs.

### **Agave 2.1 Change Log**
- **Key Deprecations**:
  - **`cargo build-bpf` and `cargo test-bpf`**:
    - Deprecated for two years and will be officially removed in 2.1.
    - Use `cargo build-spf` and `cargo test-spf` instead.

- **New Features**:
  1. **No Alloc Entry Point**:
     - Saves **20-30 CU per unique account** in the entry point.
     - Provides performance improvements with minimal effort.
  2. **Tools Version Specification**:
     - Allows developers to explicitly declare the platform tools version in `cargo.toml`:
       - Can be applied globally to the repo or individually to programs in a workspace.
       - Alternatively, pass the version via CLI arguments during `cargo build-spf`.

## **Feature Gate Activations**
- **Activation Schedule**:
  - Feature gates are being activated again with a maximum of **one activation per epoch**.
  - Developers can estimate when features will go live using the feature gate schedule.

- **Notable Features**:
  1. **More Accounts in CPIs**:
     - **Max CPI Account Info** increased from 32 to 128 accounts.
     - **Max CPI Instruction Data Length** also increased.
  2. **Clone Feature Set**:
     - A new flag for running local test validators with specific feature sets.

## **Recent Commits and Improvements**
1. **Windows Build Fix**:
   - Fixes an error that makes it easier to build on Windows without relying on WSL.  
   - Progress toward **native Windows support**.

2. **Voting with QUIC**:
   - **Anza team** improvements:
     - Votes will now use the **QUIC protocol** for faster communication.
   - **Validator Requirements**:
     - Minimum 17 ports required for QUIC voting functionality.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Replaces UDP for better reliability and performance.

3. **Loaded Program Size and CU Costs**:
   - **New CU Costs**:
     - Loaded account/program size now contributes to CU costs.
     - **8 CUs per 32 KB** of data loaded in a transaction.
   - **Optimization Tips**:
     - Optimize programs to reduce CU usage.
     - Use the **compute budget instruction** to set the `max loaded` value for transactions:
       - Smaller transactions are prioritized by the scheduler in 2.0.

## **Developer Tools and Libraries**
1. **Solana Program Library Migration**:
   - SPL programs are being moved to the **Solana Program Organization** on GitHub.
   - **Impact**:
     - New client libraries for popular programs like `Account Lookup Tables`, `Compute Budget`, `Memo`, `Token`, and `Token 22`.
     - Autogenerated clients using **Kodama**.

2. **Solana Web3.js Version 2**:
   - **Status**:
     - Already live as `version 2`.
     - On **December 16**, `latest` will default to `version 2`.
   - **Action for Developers**:
     - Update tutorials, guides, and projects to explicitly use `v1` if backward compatibility is needed.
   - **Improvements**:
     - Faster and more efficient.
     - Feedback and questions are encouraged on **Stack Exchange**.

## **Hackathon Updates**
- **Radar Hackathon**:
  - The **largest hackathon ever** hosted by Solana.
  - Winners announced:
    - Example: **Gaming Super Size** project.
  - **Action**:
    - Explore and follow the winning projects for inspiration and updates.
