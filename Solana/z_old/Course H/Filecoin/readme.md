# **Detailed Breakdown**

## **Introduction**
- **Speaker**: H  
- **Topic**: Collaboration between the Filecoin and Solana communities to store and make Solana’s data accessible via the Filecoin network.  
- **Filecoin Overview**:  
  - Largest decentralized storage network.  
  - Stores **2-3 petabytes daily** and **exabytes in total**.  
  - Capable of storing all Solana Ledger data multiple times over.

## **Key Benefits of Filecoin for Solana**
- **Full Verifiability**:
  - All data is fully verifiable.  
  - Zero-knowledge proofs ensure storage providers (SPs) are storing data correctly.  
- **Random Access**:
  - Enables random access to all Solana data.  
- **Scalability**:
  - Filecoin is ready to help Solana scale by storing and making all data easily accessible.  

---

## **Current Challenges**
- **Software Integration**:
  - Connecting the Filecoin network to the Solana network and its applications requires improved software solutions.  
- **Data Accessibility**:
  - Ensuring applications can easily access and retrieve stored data.

## **Current Use Cases**
1. **IPFS and Filecoin for Solana Applications**:
   - **Storage and Distribution**:
     - Applications use IPFS and Filecoin to store and distribute data.  
   - **Examples**:
     - NFTs, media, frontend assets for decentralized applications (dApps).  

2. **Decentralized Website Hosting**:
   - Entire websites, media, and assets are stored on IPFS and backed up on Filecoin.  
   - **How It Works**:
     - Publish content to IPFS.  
     - Back it up on Filecoin or other pinning services.  
     - Use a **CID (Content Identifier)** in Solana Name Service (SNS) records.  
     - Applications can retrieve data via:
       - Direct IPFS network requests.
       - Transparent proxies like **forol.doxyz** (built by SNS and Foreverland teams).

## **Major Projects and Progress**
1. **Backing Up the Solana Ledger**:
   - **Old Faithful**:
     - A project to store the entire Solana Ledger on Filecoin.  
     - Provides decentralized archiving and random access to the data.  
   - **Capabilities**:
     - Archives both state data and transaction history.  
     - Accessible through RPCs or directly via CIDs.  

2. **Indices and Random Access**:
   - **Upcoming Features**:
     - Provide indices for accessing compressed and ZK-compressed data.  
     - Enable efficient storage and retrieval for backend and frontend applications.  
   - **Access Methods**:
     - Servers, mobile devices, and browsers will be able to retrieve data seamlessly.  

3. **Automatic Backups**:
   - Plan to back up **NFT media**, **websites**, and other Solana data automatically as it is published on-chain.

## **Future Developments**
1. **Enhanced Data Accessibility**:
   - Through IPFS Gateways:
     - Solana data will be accessible to any browser.  
   - Goal: Ensure seamless data retrieval for all Solana users and applications.  

2. **Native Index Construction**:
   - **Integration with Solana Programs**:
     - Build indices directly into Solana programs (SVM).  
     - Automate index creation for efficient data access.  

3. **Expansion of Data Types**:
   - Beyond the ledger:
     - Focus on ZK-compressed data, websites, media, and other objects.  
   - Enable storage and access for all types of Solana-related data.

## **Key Takeaways**
- **Filecoin’s Role**:
  - Already storing a significant portion of Solana’s data, including NFTs, media, and applications.  
  - Backing up a large fraction of the Solana ledger.  
- **Next Steps**:
  - Expand to include all compressed data, objects, and media.  
  - Ensure full accessibility and scalability for Solana’s growing data needs.
