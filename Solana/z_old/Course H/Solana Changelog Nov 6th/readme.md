**1. SIMD 187/189: Stricter ELF Headers**  
- **Proposed by**: Alexander (Anza)  
- **Objective**: Restrict ELF headers to improve efficiency and reduce attack surface.  
- **Key Points**:  
  - Reduces runtime processing of unnecessary header data.  
  - Limits ability to add non-standard data (e.g., security tags, IDLs) to ELF files.  
  - Potential trade-off: Limits flexibility for custom header use cases.  
  - Labeled as SIMD 187 but likely to be updated to **SIMD 189**.

- **Status**: Pre-release, official release imminent.  
- **Breaking Change**:  
  - **Dalek curve dependency** fix (resolves a long-standing issue since 2022).  
  - **Dependency conflict resolution**:  
    - Pin to Agave 2.0 *or* upgrade all dependencies to 2.1.  
    - Mixing 2.0 and 2.1 crates is unsupported.

**4. Borsh Helpers Extraction**  
- **Change**: Borsh serialization/deserialization helpers moved from `solana-program` to **`solana-borsh` crate**.
