# **Solana's Largest Existential Risk**

---

## **Overview**
- **Author**: Temp XYZ.
- **Topic**: Analysis of Solana's largest existential risk, focusing on **MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)** and **sandwich attacks**.
- **Key Concern**: Centralization of MEV profits and its impact on Solana's ecosystem.

---

## **Key Points**

### **1. MEV and Sandwich Attacks**
- **Definition**:
  - **MEV**: Profit extracted by reordering, inserting, or censoring transactions.
  - **Sandwich Attacks**: A type of MEV where an attacker places transactions before and after a victim's transaction to manipulate prices.
- **Current State**:
  - Significant MEV activity on Solana, particularly in **meme coin trading**.
  - **Temporal's Data**: Highlighted a single entity making millions daily from sandwich attacks.

### **2. Centralization of MEV Profits**
- **Issue**:
  - MEV profits are concentrated in the hands of a few entities.
  - **GTO MEV Pool**: Previously decentralized MEV profits, but now offline, leading to centralized extraction.
- **Impact**:
  - **Stakers**: No longer benefit from MEV profits.
  - **Ecosystem Health**: Centralization poses a risk to Solana's decentralization and fairness.

### **3. Proposed Solutions**
- **Whitelist Validators**:
  - **Idea**: DApps send transactions only to trusted validators.
  - **Drawbacks**:
    - Slower transaction inclusion.
    - Creates a permissioned environment, contrary to blockchain principles.
- **Re-enable GTO MEV Pool**:
  - **Idea**: Bring back the public MEV pool to decentralize profits.
  - **Benefits**:
    - Returns MEV profits to stakers.
    - Encourages competition among validators.

### **4. Community and Developer Perspectives**
- **User Behavior**:
  - Many users (e.g., Telegram bot traders) prioritize **fast inclusion** over MEV protection.
  - **MEV Protect**: Existing solutions like Jito's MEV Protect are underutilized.
- **Long-Term Solutions**:
  - **Protocol-Level Changes**:
    - Multi-proposer models.
    - Decentralized MEV solutions.
  - **Data-Driven Decisions**:
    - Need for more data to understand the full impact of MEV and sandwiching.

---

## **Key Data and Claims**
- **Temporal's Findings**:
  - A single entity is making **$2 million daily** from sandwich attacks.
  - **Centralization Risk**: Profits are not being redistributed to stakers, leading to potential centralization.
- **Jito's MEV Protect**:
  - **Adoption**: Low, as users prefer faster transaction inclusion.
  - **Effectiveness**: Limited, as it doesn't fully prevent sandwiching at the protocol level.

---

## **Community Feedback**
- **Negative Sentiment Towards Whitelists**:
  - Seen as counter to Solana's permissionless ethos.
  - Could harm users who prioritize speed over protection.
- **Support for Decentralized Solutions**:
  - Preference for protocol-level changes over temporary fixes.
  - Emphasis on long-term solutions like multi-proposer models.

---

## **Conclusion**
- **Urgency**: Addressing MEV centralization is critical for Solana's long-term health.
- **Next Steps**:
  - **Data Collection**: More data needed to inform decisions.
  - **Protocol Changes**: Exploration of decentralized MEV solutions.
  - **Community Involvement**: Continued discussion and feedback from validators, developers, and users.
