## **Section 1: Core Architecture & Consensus (Questions 1-25)**

**1. How does Proof of History actually work at the cryptographic level?**
Answer: PoH uses recursive SHA-256 hashes to create a verifiable delay function (VDF). Each hash includes the previous hash's output plus the current transaction data, creating a cryptographic clock that proves time ordering without network communication.

**2. What's the exact relationship between leader rotation and PoH?**
Answer: Leaders are selected every 4 slots (1.6 seconds) using a deterministic function based on stake weight. PoH provides the time ordering that makes leader selection predictable, eliminating the need for expensive consensus rounds.

**3. How do Turbine and Gulf Stream work together for transaction propagation?**
Answer: Gulf Stream pushes transactions to upcoming leaders before they're scheduled, while Turbine breaks blocks into 64KB packets and uses a Reed-Solomon erasure coding tree structure for parallel propagation across validator tiers.

**4. Explain the exact memory layout of Solana accounts**
Answer: Accounts contain [lamports: u64, owner: Pubkey, executable: bool, rent_epoch: u64, data: Vec<u8>]. The data field has a 10MB limit with 4KB minimum rent-exempt balance per 10KB.

**5. How does Sealevel process transactions in parallel?**
Answer: Sealevel analyzes transaction instructions to determine account access patterns, creates a dependency graph, and executes non-conflicting transactions in parallel using a custom BPF VM with JIT compilation.

**6. What's the precise difference between CPI and cross-program invocations?**
Answer: CPI (Cross-Program Invocation) allows programs to call other programs with a maximum depth of 4. Each CPI costs 2100 compute units and requires re-serializing account data.

**7. How does Solana handle fork choice exactly?**
Answer: Solana uses a combination of heaviest chain (most stake-weighted confirmations) and latest tick height. Validators switch forks only if the new fork has 2/3 stake confirmation and higher tick height.

**8. Explain the exact compute unit economics**
Answer: Each transaction gets 1.4M compute units maximum. Instructions cost: secp256k1=25k, ed25519=3.3k, SHA256=2.1k per 32 bytes, CPI=2.1k base + 210 per account.

**9. How does rent exemption calculation work?**
Answer: Rent exemption = (2 years * account_size * rent_rate) / 1 billion. Current rent rate is ~19.1 lamports per byte-epoch. 10KB account needs ~0.002 SOL for exemption.

**10. What's the exact validator hardware requirement impact?**
Answer: Recommended specs: 12+ cores, 128GB RAM, 2x 1TB NVMe in RAID 0. This handles 1GBPS transaction processing and maintains 100ms block times under full load.

**11. How do vote credits translate to rewards?**
Answer: Each valid vote earns 1 credit. Rewards = (total_epoch_rewards * validator_credits) / total_credits_all_validators. Maximum 432,000 credits per epoch if voting on every block.

**12. Explain the precise transaction size limits**
Answer: Maximum transaction size is 1232 bytes. This includes signatures (64 bytes each), message header (3 bytes), account keys (32 bytes each), instructions, and 1-byte instruction count.

**13. How does the recent blockhash mechanism prevent replay attacks?**
Answer: Transactions must include a blockhash from the last 150 slots (≈1 minute). Once processed, the transaction's signature is stored for that blockhash, preventing identical transactions.

**14. What's the exact relationship between slots, blocks, and epochs?**
Answer: 1 slot = 400ms minimum, 1 block = 1 or more slots, 1 epoch = 432,000 slots (≈2 days). Leaders can produce multiple blocks per slot if they have transactions.

**15. How does the BPF loader handle program upgrades?**
Answer: Programs are immutable by default. Upgradeable programs use a separate ProgramData account containing the actual bytecode. The upgrade authority must sign a transaction replacing the ProgramData.

**16. Explain the precise staking warmup/cooldown mechanics**
Answer: Stake activation/deactivation occurs over epochs. The change is gradual: effective_stake = (current_epoch - activation_epoch) * total_stake / warmup_cooldown_epochs (normally 1).

**17. How do validator commission rates work exactly?**
Answer: Validators set commission (0-100%) on rewards. If commission is 10%, validator gets 10% of delegation rewards plus 100% of their self-stake rewards. Commission changes take effect next epoch.

**18. What's the exact process for transaction fee collection?**
Answer: 50% of fees are burned, 50% go to the leader that processed the transaction. Base fee is 5,000 lamports per signature, plus 21,000 lamports per writable account.

**19. How does the gossip protocol work for validator discovery?**
Answer: Validators maintain a CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) of contact information. New validators connect to bootstrap nodes and exchange contact lists using a push-pull gossip mechanism.

**20. Explain the precise account ownership model**
Answer: Only the owner program can modify account data or deduct lamports. Anyone can add lamports. Executable accounts are immutable and owned by the BPF loader.

**21. How do program-derived addresses work technically?**
Answer: PDAs are generated using SHA-256 hash of [program_id, seeds, bump_seed]. The bump seed (0-255) ensures the result isn't on the ed25519 curve, so no private key exists.

**22. What's the exact process for epoch boundary calculations?**
Answer: Epoch boundaries use a deterministic function: epoch = slot / 432000. Leader schedules are calculated using the epoch's random seed from stake weights 2 epochs prior.

**23. How does the turbine fanout mechanism work?**
Answer: Turbine uses a 200-node fanout factor. Data is split into packets, erasure coded with 1:1 redundancy, and propagated through a tree structure with validators grouped by stake weight.

**24. Explain the precise vote transaction structure**
Answer: Vote transactions contain a Vote instruction with [slot, confirmation_count, hash] for each voted block. They include 1-32 votes and cost 2,100 compute units to process.

**25. How do account data allocations work exactly?**
Answer: Account data size is fixed at creation. Reallocation requires: system program ownership, signature from account key, sufficient lamports for rent exemption, and new size ≤ 10MB.

## **Section 2: Advanced Programming & Security (Questions 26-75)**

**26. How do you implement reentrancy guards in Solana programs?**
Answer: Use a boolean flag in account data that's checked at entry and exit. Store it in a PDA that's passed to every CPI call. Cost: 113 compute units per check.

**27. What's the exact process for handling integer overflow in Rust BPF?**
Answer: Enable overflow-checks = true in Cargo.toml. This adds checked arithmetic operations. For manual handling: use checked_add(), wrapping_add(), or saturate_add() depending on requirements.

**28. How do you implement time locks without relying on system time?**
Answer: Use slot-based timing: Store target_slot = Clock::get()?.slot + delay_slots. Check current slot exceeds target. 1 slot ≈ 400ms, so 21,600 slots ≈ 2.4 hours.

**29. Explain the precise security implications of account_info.clone()**
Answer: Cloning AccountInfo creates a shallow copy pointing to the same underlying data. Both copies can modify the account simultaneously, leading to race conditions in multi-instruction transactions.

**30. How do you validate PDA seeds efficiently?**
Answer: Pre-calculate expected PDAs using Pubkey::find_program_address() and compare against provided accounts. Cache results in program state to avoid recalculation. Cost: ~2,500 compute units.

**31. What's the exact process for handling upgradeable program security?**
Answer: Implement upgrade authority multisig, timelock delays, and program data verification. Use a proxy pattern where the authority must sign upgrades, and emit events for monitoring.

**32. How do you prevent account confusions attacks precisely?**
Answer: Validate all accounts using: 1) Expected owner program, 2) Correct data size, 3) Expected discriminator, 4) PDA verification, 5) Mutability requirements match usage.

**33. Explain the compute unit optimization techniques for complex algorithms**
Answer: 1) Use iterative instead of recursive algorithms, 2) Pre-calculate constants off-chain, 3) Use bitwise operations instead of division, 4) Minimize CPI calls, 5) Use Borsh instead of JSON.

**34. How do you implement secure randomness without Chainlink VRF?**
Answer: Combine recent blockhashes, slot numbers, and user-provided seeds. Hash together with SHA-256: hash(blockhash || slot || user_seed). Not truly random but unpredictable for practical use.

**35. What's the exact process for handling large data structures?**
Answer: Use account data paging: split data across multiple accounts with a root account containing page addresses. Implement lazy loading for pages. Maximum 10MB per account, 1.4MB per transaction.

**36. How do you implement access control efficiently?**
Answer: Use role-based permissions stored in a PDA. Implement modifiers: #[access_control(has_role(user, Role::Admin))]. Store roles as bitflags for efficient storage and checking.

**37. Explain the precise handling of failed CPI calls**
Answer: Failed CPI calls return Err(ProgramError). The calling transaction fails atomically unless caught with match/catch. All state changes roll back, but account lamport changes persist.

**38. How do you implement rate limiting in Solana programs?**
Answer: Use token bucket algorithm: store tokens and last_refill_slot in account. Calculate tokens = min(max_tokens, current_tokens + (slot_delta * refill_rate)). Deduct tokens for operations.

**39. What's the exact security model for program upgrades?**
Answer: Upgradeable programs have a ProgramData account separate from the Program account. The upgrade authority can replace ProgramData. Buffer accounts temporarily hold new bytecode during deployment.

**40. How do you handle floating-point calculations securely?**
Answer: Avoid floating-point entirely. Use fixed-point arithmetic with u128: represent 1.5 as 15 * 10^17 / 10^18. Implement checked operations to prevent overflow.

**41. Explain the precise handling of account reallocations**
Answer: Use realloc() system instruction with: current account key signature, sufficient lamports for new rent exemption, size increase ≤ 10MB total. Data is zero-padded when increasing size.

**42. How do you implement merkle proofs efficiently?**
Answer: Store merkle root in program state. Users provide proof path with siblings. Verify by hashing up the tree: hash(hash(left || right)) == root. Cost: ~2,100 compute units per level.

**43. What's the exact process for handling composite accounts?**
Answer: Use account validation structs: #[derive(Accounts)] with validation rules. Implement custom validation: validate_account_compatibility(&self) -> Result<(), ProgramError>.

**44. How do you prevent front-running in DEX implementations?**
Answer: Implement commit-reveal scheme: users commit to hash(order_params || secret), then reveal after delay. Use slot-based expiration to prevent indefinite withholding.

**45. Explain the precise handling of nested option types**
Answer: Solana's Borsh serialization handles Option<T> as 1-byte discriminator + T if Some. For nested Options: Option<Option<T>> uses 2 bytes. Be mindful of account size calculations.

**46. How do you implement efficient batch operations?**
Answer: Use single transaction with multiple instructions. Share accounts between instructions to reduce duplication. Maximum 6 instructions per transaction due to compute limits.

**47. What's the exact process for handling account closure?**
Answer: Transfer all lamports to destination, set data length to 0, and ensure no references remain. Use close_account() helper: **destination.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? += **account.try_borrow_mut_lamports()?;

**48. How do you implement signature verification efficiently?**
Answer: Use solana_program::secp256k1_recover() for Ethereum signatures. Cost: 25,000 compute units. Cache verification results to avoid re-verifying the same signature multiple times.

**49. Explain the precise handling of cross-program invocations with return values**
Answer: CPI calls can't return complex values. Use account data to communicate results: write output to a dedicated PDA that the caller reads after the CPI completes.

**50. How do you implement efficient state compression?**
Answer: Use bit packing: store multiple boolean flags in single u8. Use variable-length integers (LEB128) for small numbers. Implement custom serialization for repeated data patterns.

**51. What's the exact security consideration for system program interactions?**
Answer: Always validate that system program instructions are called with expected parameters. Attackers can create accounts with arbitrary data if you don't verify the owner field.

**52. How do you handle time-sensitive operations without block timestamps?**
Answer: Use slot numbers as a proxy for time: slots_to_time(slots) = slots * 400ms. Account for network delays and potential slot skipping in critical timing applications.

**53. Explain the precise handling of account data races**
Answer: Use atomic operations and proper borrowing patterns. Rust's borrow checker prevents data races at compile time. For cross-instruction races, use temporary accounts or sequencing.

**54. How do you implement efficient pagination for large datasets?**
Answer: Store data in linked list structure with next_page PDA. Use cursor-based pagination with page addresses. Implement bidirectional traversal with prev_page pointers.

**55. What's the exact process for handling failed account initialization?**
Answer: Check account data length and discriminator before operations. If initialization fails, return specific error: Err(MyError::AccountNotInitialized.into()). Clean up partial state on failure.

**56. How do you implement multi-signature wallets efficiently?**
Answer: Use bitflags to track signatures: signatures: u64 where each bit represents a signer. Validate signers against stored pubkeys and check threshold: signatures.count_ones() >= threshold.

**57. Explain the precise handling of program-derived address collisions**
Answer: PDA generation includes bump seeds (0-255). If find_program_address() fails, try find_program_address_with_bump() with different bumps. Collisions are practically impossible with proper seed design.

**58. How do you implement efficient event logging?**
Answer: Use emit! macro to log events. Events are stored in transaction logs, not account data. Cost: ~100 compute units per emit. Use structured events for off-chain indexing.

**59. What's the exact security model for delegate accounts?**
Answer: Delegate accounts can transfer tokens but not modify token metadata. Validate delegate authority using spl_token::state::Account::delegate and delegation_amount fields before transfers.

Answer: Use checked arithmetic everywhere: a.checked_add(b).ok_or(Error::Overflow)? Implement custom types with built-in checks: #[derive(Arbitrary)] for fuzz testing.

**61. Explain the precise handling of upgradeable program dependencies**
Answer: Pin dependency versions in Cargo.lock. Test upgrades in devnet first. Implement gradual rollout: deploy new version, test thoroughly, then update program references.

**62. How do you implement efficient merkle tree updates?**
Answer: Use sparse merkle trees for large datasets. Store only non-zero branches. Implement incremental updates: modify only affected path, keep track of root changes off-chain.

**63. What's the exact process for handling account validation failures?**
Answer: Return specific error codes for each validation failure: InvalidOwner, InvalidSize, InvalidDiscriminator. Implement helper functions for common validations to reduce code duplication.

**64. How do you prevent integer division precision loss?**
