# What test network to use prior to deployment on OP Mainnet?
For development purposes we recommend you use either a local development node or  [OP Goerli](https://blockscout.com/optimism/goerli). That way you don't need to spend real money. If you need ETH on OP Goerli for testing purposes, you can find a list of testnet faucets  [here](https://community.optimism.io/docs/useful-tools/faucets/#).  
  

Both  [Etherscan](https://goerli-optimism.etherscan.io/)  and  [Blockscout](https://blockscout.com/optimism/goerli)  support OP Goerli.
