### What is Paymaster?

Paymaster is a specialized contract or service that sponsors transaction fees for users on a blockchain network. Instead of each user paying for their transactions directly, the Paymaster can cover these costs, allowing for more flexible and user-friendly interactions with the blockchain.

### Why Paymaster?

The high cost of transaction fees (gas fees) on blockchain networks can be a barrier to entry for many users, especially those making microtransactions or participating in decentralized applications (dApps). Paymaster aims to reduce this barrier by allowing third parties to subsidize transaction fees, enhancing the user experience and broadening access to blockchain services.


## How Paymaster Works

### Sponsoring Transaction Fees

Paymaster works by sponsoring the transaction fees for users. This involves:

-   **Funding**: The Paymaster contract is funded with sufficient cryptocurrency to cover transaction fees.
-   **Verification**: When a user initiates a transaction, the Paymaster verifies that the transaction meets its criteria for sponsorship.
-   **Payment**: The Paymaster pays the transaction fee on behalf of the user, allowing the transaction to proceed without the user needing to hold the required cryptocurrency for fees.


1.  **What Are Paymasters?**
    
    -   **Paymasters**  are smart contracts that facilitate flexible gas payment policies within decentralized applications (DApps).
    -   [They allow someone else (e.g., a sponsor) to pay gas fees on behalf of a smart account, enhancing user experience and flexibility](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/what-is-a-paymaster)[1](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/what-is-a-paymaster).
2.  **How Do Paymasters Work?**
    
    -   When a user initiates a transaction, the Paymaster assesses whether to accept it during the verification stage.
    -   If accepted, the Paymaster sponsors the gas fees for executing the transaction.
    -   [This sponsorship can be done using the blockchainâ€™s native currency or an ERC-20 token (e.g., USDC)](https://usa.visa.com/solutions/crypto/rethink-digital-transactions-with-account-abstraction.html)[2](https://usa.visa.com/solutions/crypto/rethink-digital-transactions-with-account-abstraction.html).
