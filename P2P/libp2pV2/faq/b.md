# üîó libp2p Senior Engineer Interview Questions

## üìò Section 1: Fundamentals

### **1. What is libp2p and why is it important in decentralized systems?**

**Answer:**
libp2p is a **modular networking stack** designed for **peer-to-peer (P2P) applications**. It abstracts network communication into composable modules such as transport, peer discovery, peer routing, multiplexing, NAT traversal, and more.

**Importance:**

* Enables **network agnosticism** and **protocol flexibility**
* Powers distributed systems like **IPFS, Filecoin, Ethereum 2.0, and Polkadot**
* Provides **extensibility** to swap or upgrade modules without affecting others

**Follow-up:**

* *How does libp2p compare to traditional client-server networking models?*
* *Name three systems that rely on libp2p and how they use it differently.*

---

### **2. Describe the architecture and modular components of libp2p.**

**Answer:**
Key components:

* **Transport** (e.g., TCP, QUIC, WebSockets)
* **Multiplexing** (e.g., Yamux, Mplex)
* **Encryption** (e.g., Noise, TLS)
* **Peer Routing** (e.g., Kademlia DHT)
* **Peer Discovery** (e.g., mDNS, Bootstrap)
* **NAT Traversal** (e.g., UPnP, AutoNAT)
* **Relay/Proxy** (e.g., Circuit Relay)

**Follow-up:**

* *How would you replace Mplex with Yamux in a running libp2p node?*
* *Which components are stateful, and how does libp2p manage their lifecycle?*

---

### **3. Explain the role of Peer IDs in libp2p. How are they generated and used?**

**Answer:**

* A **Peer ID** is a **cryptographic hash of a public key** (e.g., SHA-256 of a RSA/Ed25519 public key).
* It's used for:

  * **Authentication**
  * **Establishing trust**
  * **Routing and addressing**

**Follow-up:**

* *What happens if a peer changes its private key?*
* *Can two peers have the same Peer ID? Why or why not?*

---

## üß† Section 2: Intermediate ‚Äì Practical Design & Code

### **4. Write a basic libp2p node in Go that supports TCP transport and mDNS discovery.**

**Answer (Go, abbreviated):**

```go
host, _ := libp2p.New(
  libp2p.Transport(tcp.NewTCPTransport),
  libp2p.ListenAddrStrings("/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/0"),
  libp2p.DefaultSecurity,
)

mdns, _ := mdns.NewMdnsService(ctx, host, time.Second*10, "myapp-mdns")
mdns.RegisterNotifee(&discoveryNotifee{})
```

**Follow-up:**

* *How would you make this node browser-compatible using WebRTC?*
* *Add a ping protocol handler that responds to ‚Äúping‚Äù with ‚Äúpong‚Äù.*

---

### **5. How does libp2p handle NAT traversal?**

**Answer:**
libp2p supports:

* **AutoNAT**: probes connectivity status
* **Hole punching** (using QUIC and relay nodes)
* **UPnP / NAT-PMP**: port mapping
* **Circuit Relay v2**: acts as a fallback when direct connection fails

**Follow-up:**

* *What are the tradeoffs of using circuit relays vs hole punching?*
* *How would you detect if a peer is behind symmetric NAT?*

---

### **6. Explain multiplexing in libp2p. Why is it necessary?**

**Answer:**
Multiplexing allows **multiple logical streams** over a **single physical connection**. Required because:

* Saves resources
* Allows parallel communication without multiple connections

Common muxers: **Yamux**, **Mplex**

**Follow-up:**

* *Compare Yamux and Mplex in terms of performance and spec compliance.*
* *What happens if a muxed stream hangs? How does libp2p handle it?*

---

## üß™ Section 3: Edge Cases & Tricky Scenarios

### **7. How does libp2p prevent Sybil attacks during peer discovery and routing?**

**Answer:**
libp2p doesn't prevent Sybil attacks by default but provides primitives:

* **Peer identity** is tied to **public keys**
* DHTs (e.g., Kademlia) rely on **distance-based heuristics**
* **Application-layer solutions** like reputation systems, stake, or attestations are needed

**Follow-up:**

* *How would you design a Sybil-resistant discovery layer using libp2p primitives?*

---

### **8. How would you debug inconsistent peer connections in a libp2p network?**

**Answer:**
Steps:

* **Enable debug logging**
* Use `libp2p/net/connmgr` metrics
* Monitor:

  * NAT status
  * Peer discovery events
  * Multiplexed stream failures
* Tools: **`ipfs swarm peers`**, Wireshark, log tracing

**Follow-up:**

* *What could cause a peer to frequently disconnect and reconnect?*

---

### **9. What are the limitations of libp2p DHT and how can they be mitigated?**

**Answer:**

* High **latency** and **churn sensitivity**
* Vulnerable to **eclipse attacks**
* Poor performance in **low peer-count scenarios**

Mitigations:

* Use **caching**
* Add **probabilistic queries**
* Use **routing tables with richer metadata**

**Follow-up:**

* *How would you extend the Kademlia DHT to include node reputation scores?*
