P2P networks can take many forms, including file-sharing systems like [BitTorrent](https://www.bittorrent.com/), blockchain networks like [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), and decentralized communication standards like [Matrix](https://matrix.org/). These systems all have different challenges and tradeoffs, but they share the goal of improving upon the traditional client-server networking model.
