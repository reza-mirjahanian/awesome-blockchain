Peer IDÂ 
--------

A Peer Identity (often writtenÂ `PeerID`) is a unique reference to a specific peer within the overall peer-to-peer network.

As well as serving as a unique identifier for each peer, a Peer ID is a verifiable link between a peer and its public cryptographic key.

Each libp2p peer controls a private key, which it keeps secret from all other peers. Every private key has a corresponding public key, which is shared with other peers.

Together, the public and private key (or "key pair") allow peers to establishÂ [secure communication](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/secure-comm/overview/)Â channels with each other.

Conceptually, a Peer ID is aÂ [cryptographic hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function)Â of a peer's public key. When peers establish a secure channel, the hash can be used to verify that the public key used to secure the channel is the same one used to identify the peer.

TheÂ [Peer ID spec](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/peer-ids/peer-ids.md)Â goes into detail about the byte formats used for libp2p public keys and how to hash the key to produce a valid Peer ID.


### How are Peer Ids represented as strings?Â 

Peer Ids areÂ [multihashes](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/appendix/glossary#multihash), which are defined as a compact binary format.

It's very common to see multihashes encoded intoÂ [base 58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base58), usingÂ [the same alphabet used by bitcoin](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Base58#Alphabet_Base58).

Here's an example of a Peer ID represented as a base58-encoded multihash:Â `QmYyQSo1c1Ym7orWxLYvCrM2EmxFTANf8wXmmE7DWjhx5N`

While it's possible to represent multihashes in many textual formats (for example as hexadecimal, base64, etc), Peer IdsÂ *always*Â use the base58 encoding, with noÂ [multibase prefix](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase)Â when encoded into strings.


### Peer IDs in multiaddrsÂ 

A Peer ID can be encoded into aÂ [multiaddr](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/appendix/glossary#multiaddr)Â as aÂ `/p2p`Â address with the Peer ID as a parameter.

If my Peer ID isÂ `QmYyQSo1c1Ym7orWxLYvCrM2EmxFTANf8wXmmE7DWjhx5N`, a libp2p multiaddress for me would be:

```
`/p2p/QmYyQSo1c1Ym7orWxLYvCrM2EmxFTANf8wXmmE7DWjhx5N
`
```

As with other multiaddrs, aÂ `/p2p`Â address can be encapsulated into another multiaddr to compose into a new multiaddr. For example, I can combine the above with aÂ [transport](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/transports/overview/)Â addressÂ `/ip4/198.51.100.0/tcp/4242`Â to produce this very useful address:

```
`/ip4/198.51.100.0/tcp/4242/p2p/QmYyQSo1c1Ym7orWxLYvCrM2EmxFTANf8wXmmE7DWjhx5N
`
```

This provides enough information to dial a specific peer over a TCP/IP transport. If some other peer has taken over that IP address or port, it will be immediately obvious, since they will not have control over the key pair used to produce the Peer ID embedded in the address.

For more on addresses in libp2p, seeÂ [Addressing](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/fundamentals/addressing/)

ðŸ’¡The multiaddr protocol for libp2p addresses was originally writtenÂ `/ipfs`Â and was later renamed toÂ `/p2p`. The two are equivalent and have the same binary representation in multiaddrs. Which one is rendered in the string format depends on the version of the multiaddr library in use.


Peer InfoÂ 
----------

Another common libp2p data structure related to peer identity is theÂ `PeerInfo`Â structure.

Peer Info combines a Peer ID with a set ofÂ [multiaddrs](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/appendix/glossary#multiaddr)Â that the peer is listening on.

Peer StoreÂ 
-----------

A libp2p node will typically have a temporary store to store peer keys, addresses and associated metadata. The peer store works like a phone or address book; think of it like a universal multiaddr book that maintains the source of truth for all known peers.

ðŸ’¡Implementations may wish to persist a snapshot of the peer store on shutdown, so that they don't have to start with an empty peer store when they boot up the next time.

### Peer DiscoveryÂ 

A discovery method is likely needed if no information about a peer is available in the peer store. A peer multiaddr is typically discovered with their Peer ID. Once the network successfully discovers a peer multiaddr (and able to establish a connection), the peer discovery protocol adds the Peer Info and multiaddr to the Peer Store.
