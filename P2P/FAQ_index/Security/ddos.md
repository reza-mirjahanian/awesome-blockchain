# DoS Mitigation in libp2p

## What is DoS Mitigation?

DoS mitigation ensures P2P applications remain resilient against malicious peers through:
- **Protocol design** - Build resilient protocols from the start
- **Monitoring** - Watch for suspicious activity and attacks
- **Response** - React effectively when attacks occur

## Understanding DoS Attacks

A DoS attack causes applications to **crash**, **stall**, or **fail to respond normally**. An attack is viable when:

> *Resources to execute < Damage inflicted*

### Common Attack Vectors

1. **Resource Amplification**
   - Attacker opens many connections
   - Forces target to spend 10x more compute time
   - Scales with additional attacker nodes

2. **Asset-Based Attacks**
   - 100 nodes target single critical node
   - Node failure causes valuable asset loss
   - Viable if asset value > compute cost

3. **Eclipse Attacks**
   - Many nodes connect to isolate target
   - Prevents honest peer connections
   - Viable if cheap to execute or high payoff

## Design Strategies

### Core Principles

- **Minimize resource usage**
- **Eliminate untrusted amplification**
- **Implement protocol-level reputation** (see [GossipSub](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/pubsub/gossipsub))
- **Log misbehavior** for automated blocking

### 1. Connection Limits

Each connection consumes resources. Limit total connections to reduce attack surface.

#### go-libp2p
```go
// ConnManager - trims connections at high watermark
// Resource Manager - hard limits for creation
```

#### rust-libp2p
```rust
// connection_keep_alive() - defines when to close
// ConnectionLimits - sets hard limits
```

#### js-libp2p
See [connection limits documentation](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/master/doc/LIMITS.md#connection-limits)

### 2. Transient Connection Limits

Before security/muxer negotiation, connections are "transient" (go) or "negotiating" (rust). Both implementations limit these by default.

**Configuration:**
- **go-libp2p**: Adjust transient scope connection limit
- **rust-libp2p**: Use `ConnectionLimits`
- **js-libp2p**: Set `maxIncomingPendingConnections`

### 3. Stream Limits

Limit concurrent streams per connection to prevent resource exhaustion.

**Design Pattern:**
```
❌ Bad: Keep stream open for minutes-long RPC
✅ Good: Open stream → Send request → Close → Receive response on new stream
```

**Implementation Examples:**
- **go-libp2p**: See Identify protocol's `pushSemaphore`
- **rust-libp2p**: See `MAX_NUM_INBOUND_SUBSTREAMS` in Kademlia
- **js-libp2p**: Per-multiplexer limits + protocol-level limits

### 4. Additional Mitigation Strategies

#### Process Separation
Split applications into separate processes to reduce blast radius:
- Consensus process
- User query process

#### Rate Limiting
Use `ConnectionGater` and `InterceptAccept` to limit inbound connection rates.

#### Resource Management (go-libp2p)
The Resource Manager tracks usage per:
- Protocol
- Peer  
- Connection
- System scope

## Monitoring

### Metrics Collection

- **rust-libp2p**: `libp2p-metrics` crate
- **go-libp2p**: OpenCensus metrics from Resource Manager
- **js-libp2p**: [System metrics documentation](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/master/doc/METRICS.md)

### Canonical Logging (go-libp2p)

Enable special log format to identify misbehaving peers:

```bash
# Enable logging
GOLOG_LOG_LEVEL="canonical-log=info"
```

**Example log:**
```
CANONICAL_PEER_STATUS: peer=12D3KooW... addr=/ip4/147.75.74.239/udp/4001/quic sample_rate=100 connection_status="established" dir="inbound"
```

## Attack Response

### 1. Identify Misbehaving Peers

**go-libp2p**: Use canonical log lines  
**rust-libp2p**: Log `SwarmEvent` samples  
**js-libp2p**: Set `DEBUG` environment variable

### 2. Manual Blocking

Extract IP from multiaddr and block:
```bash
sudo ufw deny from 192.0.2.0
```

### 3. Automated Blocking with fail2ban

#### Filter Configuration
```ini
# /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/go-libp2p-peer-status.conf
[Definition]
failregex = ^.*[\t\s]CANONICAL_PEER_STATUS: .* addr=\/ip[46]\/<HOST>[^\s]*
```

#### Jail Configuration
```ini
# /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/go-libp2p-weird-behavior-iptables.conf
[go-libp2p-weird-behavior-iptables]
enabled = true
filter = go-libp2p-peer-status
action = iptables-allports[name=go-libp2p-fail2ban]
backend = systemd[journalflags=1]
journalmatch = _SYSTEMD_UNIT=ipfs-daemon.service
findtime = 180  # 3 minutes
bantime = 600   # 10 minutes
maxretry = 90   # ~50 attempts/second over 3 minutes
```

#### Setup Steps
1. Install fail2ban
2. Copy filter and jail files to correct locations
3. Enable canonical logging
4. Restart fail2ban: `systemctl restart fail2ban`
5. Verify: `fail2ban-client status go-libp2p-weird-behavior-iptables`

### 4. Allow/Deny Lists

**go-libp2p**: Resource Manager supports trusted multiaddr lists with different limits  
**js-libp2p**: Built-in [allow/deny list mechanism](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/master/doc/LIMITS.md#allowdeny-lists)

## Key Takeaway

> Protocol developers must cover all attack vectors while attackers need only one flaw. Use libp2p's tools for better protocol design, monitor actively, and automate responses with tools like fail2ban.

## What is DoS Mitigation?

**Q: What is a DoS attack in the context of libp2p and why is it important to mitigate?**
**A:** A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is any attack that causes an application to crash, stall, or become unresponsive. It’s considered “viable” if the cost to execute is less than the damage inflicted—i.e., high payoff-to-investment ratio. Mitigation is crucial because unprotected libp2p applications can be taken offline, experience degraded performance, or suffer eclipse attacks isolating them from honest peers ([docs.libp2p.io][1]).

### Examples of DoS Attacks

**Q: Give examples of viable DoS attacks in libp2p networks.**
**A:**

* A single node opens many connections, forcing the target to use 10× more compute time.
* 100 nodes request work from one, and if that node fails, a valuable asset is lost.
* Many nodes connect to a peer, exhausting its accept queue—an eclipse attack, making the node unreachable.
  These cause crashes, stalls, or degraded performance ([docs.libp2p.io][1]).

---

## Incorporating DOS mitigation from the start

**Q: What general principle should guide DoS resilience in protocol design?**
**A:** Use minimal resources and avoid untrusted amplification—ensure no peer can force you to expend disproportionate resources. Employ protocol-level reputation systems like GossipSub and log misbehaviors for mechanisms like fail2ban .

---

## Limit the number of connections your application needs

**Q: Why limit the number of active connections?**
**A:** Each connection consumes resources—cpu, memory, bandwidth. Limiting them prevents attackers from exhausting system resources by opening many connections .

### Go-libp2p: ConnManager & Resource Manager

**Q: What are ConnManager and Resource Manager in go‑libp2p?**
**A:**

* **ConnManager**: maintains active connections within configurable *low* and *high watermarks*. It prunes connections above the high watermark while trying to stay above the low watermark.
* **Resource Manager**: enforces *hard limits* on resources; new connections fail once a limit is hit.
  Use ConnManager for flexible ranges, Resource Manager for strict caps ([docs.libp2p.io][1]).

**Q: How do you protect specific connections using ConnManager?**
**A:** With the `Protect` method on ConnManager—you can mark connections to be exempt from pruning .

### Rust-libp2p: connection\_keep\_alive & ConnectionLimits

**Q: How do you limit connections in rust‑libp2p?**
**A:** Implement `connection_keep_alive` handler to signal when connections may be closed. Also use `ConnectionLimits`, passed to `SwarmBuilder`, to enforce hard caps .

### js-libp2p: connection limits

**Q: How does js‑libp2p handle connection limits?**
**A:** Users can configure connection limits in js‑libp2p docs—likely via a connection manager with set max connections parameters .

---

## Transient Connections

**Q: What are transient (go‑libp2p) or negotiating (rust‑libp2p) connections?**
**A:** Connections that are in the handshake phase—security or muxer negotiation—not yet tied to a peer. These states can be abused in DoS attacks .

**Q: How can you limit transient connections?**
**A:**

* **go-libp2p**: tune limits in "transient" scope.
* **rust-libp2p**: set via `ConnectionLimits`.
* **js-libp2p**: adjust `maxIncomingPendingConnections` ([docs.libp2p.io][1]).

---

## Limit concurrent streams per connection

**Q: Why limit concurrent streams on a per-connection basis?**
**A:** Each stream consumes resources; too many streams cause high memory and CPU usage. Limiting concurrency avoids resource exhaustion .

### Examples: Identify protocol

**Q: How does Identify protocol limit streams in different languages?**
**A:**

* **go-libp2p**: uses `pushSemaphore` to control concurrent inbound streams.
* **rust-libp2p**: sets `MAX_NUM_INBOUND_SUBSTREAMS`.
* **js-libp2p**: multiplexer (like mplex) enforces total streams per connection and protocol-level caps ([docs.libp2p.io][1]).

### RPC use-case

**Q: Compare two RPC-style stream usage patterns and their impact.**
**A:**

1. **One stream per call, held until return** → many idle streams = high memory.
2. **Open short-lived request, then close; response opens new stream** → fewer concurrent streams, lower footprint.
   Applying a cap of 10 streams:

* Pattern 1 limits to 10 concurrent calls.
* Pattern 2 handles many more efficiently ([docs.libp2p.io][1]).

## Reduce blast radius

**Q: How does process separation improve DoS resilience?**
**A:** Splitting tasks into separate OS processes (e.g., consensus vs user queries) ensures that if one process is DoS'ed, the other remains unaffected by OS-level isolation .

---

## Fail2ban

**Q: What role does fail2ban play in DoS mitigation?**
**A:** Logs misbehaving peers and automatically blocks them via firewall rules. Go-libp2p includes built-in support. Example: recording peer IPs and banning repeat offenders .

---

## Leverage Resource Manager (go‑libp2p)

**Q: How does go‑libp2p’s Resource Manager help mitigate DoS?**
**A:** It tracks resource usage—per protocol, peer, connection—and allows developers to cap memory or compute usage within handlers. It’s a resource accounting abstraction ready for protocol-level enforcement .

---

## Rate limiting incoming connections

**Q: How do you rate-limit inbound connections?**
**A:**

* **go-libp2p**: use `ConnectionGater` and `InterceptAccept`.
* **Prysm** blockchain client demonstrates such gating.
* **js-libp2p**: has a connection gater configurable at startup; drops peers opening too many connections quickly ([docs.libp2p.io][1]).

---

## Monitoring your application

**Q: Why is monitoring important after deploying DoS defenses?**
**A:** To verify mitigation effectiveness and detect new attack patterns.

**Q: How do different implementations support metrics?**
**A:**

* **rust-libp2p**: offers `libp2p‑metrics` crate.
* **go-libp2p**: uses OpenCensus metrics via Resource Manager; more metrics work tracked (issue go‑libp2p#1356) ([docs.libp2p.io][1]).
