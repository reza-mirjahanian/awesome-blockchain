# 🌐 Overview: NAT + Firewalls

* **Public nodes**: directly reachable on the internet.
* **Private nodes**: behind NAT/firewalls—cannot accept inbound connections without help 

---

# 🔄 Traditional Path: Relay

1. Private node A connects to a public **Relay** (R).
2. B connects too; R forwards traffic A↔B.

   * Downsides: **high latency, bandwidth cost, manual setup** ([docs.libp2p.io][1]).

---

# ✳️ Hole Punching: How It Works

## 1. Basic Idea

* Both A & B send simultaneous packets (e.g., TCP SYNs) to each other via their routers.
* Routers create temporary "hole" 5‑tuple entries—the path is already mapped.
* Packets cross paths in the public internet; each router allows the incoming packet if it matches a recent outbound entry 

## 2. libp2p’s Two-Phase Method

### Phase I – Preparation

* **AutoNAT (STUN‑like)**:

  * Each node checks if it’s publicly reachable by asking other peers to dial it on its known addresses ([docs.libp2p.io][1]).
* **Find Relay**:

  * Discover public relays (e.g., via Kademlia DHT or public bootstrap nodes) ([docs.libp2p.io][1]).
* **Reserve via Circuit Relay v2**:

  * Node B connects to relay and asks for a reservation.
  * Advertises addresses of the form:

    ```text
    /<RELAY_ADDR>/p2p-circuit/<PEER_ID>
    ```
  * Keeps that relay link alive ([docs.libp2p.io][1], [blog.ipfs.tech][2]).

### Phase II – Hole‑Punching

1. **Establish secure relay tunnel**:
   A → Relay → B, using TLS over circuit-relay ([blog.ipfs.tech][2]).
2. **Coordinate via DCUtR (Direct Connection Upgrade through Relay)**:

   * A sends `Connect` (contains its predicted public address) via relay.
   * B replies with its public addresses via `Connect`.
   * A sends `Sync`; waits half RTT (measure from relay path).
   * A/B both start dialing each other **simultaneously** using these addresses, punching holes through NATs ([deepwiki.com][3], [blog.ipfs.tech][2]).

Once simultaneous dial occurs, routers allow the incoming packets; A↔B is now direct.

# 🔧 Transport Variants

* **TCP**: simultaneous connection attempts (`CONNECT` → send SYNs) ([blog.ipfs.tech][2], [deepwiki.com][3]).
* **QUIC (UDP)**: A sends packets post-`SYNC`; B sends timed UDP packets .
* **Browser constraints**: limited socket control; WebRTC or WebTransport may be used instead ([github.com][4]).

---

# 🛡️ Fallback & Real-world Notes

* If hole-punching fails (e.g., symmetric NAT), nodes **fall back to relay-only**.
* Relay capacity is **rate‑limited** ([deepwiki.com][3]).
* libp2p implementations in Go and Rust support this; DCUtR uses `/libp2p/dcutr` protocol ([docs.libp2p.io][5]).
* Also integrates:

  * **AutoNAT** + **Identify**: for address detection
  * **Circuit Relay v2**: for relayed tunnels
  * **DCUtR**: for coordination ([deepwiki.com][3], [docs.libp2p.io][5]).
