# Types of Crypto Bridges

## 1. Notary Bridges
### Explanation
Notary bridges involve a trusted third party (notary) that oversees the transfer of assets between blockchains. The notary locks the tokens on the first blockchain and mints equivalent tokens on the second blockchain.

### Popular Online Services
- **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)**: Uses BitGo as the notary to mint WBTC on Ethereum.
- **RenVM**: A decentralized network that acts as a notary for multiple blockchains.

## 2. Optimistic Bridges
### Explanation
Optimistic bridges assume transactions are valid by default and only check the validity if challenged. A relayer forwards the transaction without verifying it initially, relying on the community to detect and report fraudulent transactions.

### Popular Online Services
- **Optimism**: An Ethereum Layer 2 solution that uses optimistic rollups.
- **Arbitrum**: Another Layer 2 solution for Ethereum employing optimistic rollups.

## 3. Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLC)
### Explanation
HTLC bridges use cryptographic hashes and time constraints to ensure secure asset transfers. The transaction requires the recipient to provide a secret within a specified time frame to unlock the assets.

### Popular Online Services
- **Lightning Network**: Primarily used for Bitcoin, facilitating off-chain transactions through HTLCs.
- **Atomic Swap**: A protocol that enables direct trading of different cryptocurrencies using HTLCs.

## 4. Zero Knowledge Bridges
### Explanation
Zero knowledge bridges use zero-knowledge proofs to verify transactions without revealing the transaction details. This ensures privacy and efficiency as the blockchain only needs to verify the proof.

### Popular Online Services
- **zkSync**: A Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum using zero-knowledge rollups.
- **StarkWare**: Provides scalability and privacy solutions using zero-knowledge proofs.

# Related Terms and Idioms Used in Blockchain Bridges

### Related Terms
- **Cross-Chain**: Interactions or transfers between different blockchains.
- **Interoperability**: The ability of different blockchain networks to interact and share information.
- **Validator**: An entity that verifies and validates transactions on a blockchain.
- **Relayer**: An intermediary that forwards transactions between blockchains.
- **Merkle Proof**: A cryptographic proof used to verify the inclusion of a transaction in a Merkle tree.

- **Bridging the Gap**: Connecting two different blockchains to allow asset transfers.
- **Lock and Mint**: The process of locking assets on one blockchain and minting equivalent assets on another.
- **Double Spend**: Attempting to spend the same asset more than once on different blockchains.
- **Trustless**: A system where participants do not need to trust each other or a third party.
- **Gas Fees**: Transaction fees required to process operations on a blockchain.
