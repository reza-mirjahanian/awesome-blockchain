# What Are Blockchain Bridge 


In the world of Web3, we’ve seen a boom in both L1 blockchains and L2 scaling solutions and ways to make them faster and more efficient. But with all these options, there’s also a growing need to move stuff, like money or data, between these blockchains.


# What Are Blockchain Bridges? 🤔

Blockchain bridges are basically software tools that allow separate blockchain networks to share information and assets. 


# Different Types Of blockchain Bridges

Just like bridges in the real world come in different shapes and sizes, catering to different needs and environments, blockchain bridges also vary in their types and functions. Let’s take a closer look at the main types of blockchain bridges:

1️⃣  **Trusted Bridges (Centralized or Custodial)**: These bridges are like crossing a bridge controlled by a central authority. They focus on being easy to use and fast, making them great for beginners or quick transfers. But remember, you’re trusting this authority to hold your assets, similar to trusting a bank.  _Examples include_ [**_Binance Bridge_**](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/bnb-chain-bridges) _and_ **_Multichain._**

2️⃣  **Trustless Bridges (Decentralized or Non-Custodial):**  Think of these bridges as community-built networks, eliminating the need for a central authority. They offer more security and control, like keeping your keys under your own mattress. However, they can be more complex to use and sometimes slower.  _Examples include_ **_RenVM_** _and_ **_Thorchain_**_._

3️⃣  **Federated Bridges:**  These bridges are governed by a group of trusted entities, balancing centralization and decentralization. They aim to offer enhanced security and scalability compared to fully decentralized options. However, trust in the consortium is crucial.  _An example is the_ **_Cosmos IBC protocol_**_._

4️⃣  **Hybrid Bridges:**  These bridges combine elements of both  [**centralized and decentralized**]  models, striving to achieve a balance between security, speed, and control.  _The_ **_Huobi_**  **_Eco Chain bridge_** _is an example of this type._

5️⃣  **Layer 2 Bridges:** These bridges are like separate lanes dedicated to a specific blockchain ecosystem, focusing on making transactions faster and more efficient within that environment.  _An example is the_ **_Polygon Bridge_**_._

6️⃣  **Interoperability Bridges:** These bridges focus solely on enabling communication between different blockchains, regardless of their specific features. They prioritize breaking down communication barriers and fostering interaction between diverse blockchain ecosystems. _The_  [**_Cosmos IBC protocol_**](https://cosmos.network/ibc/) _falls into this category._

7️⃣  **Liquidity Bridges:** These bridges act as pools of assets, allowing users to swap tokens across different blockchains. It’s like dipping your token into one pool and getting its equivalent in another.  _Examples include_ **_RenBTC_** _and_ **_WBTC_**_._

8️⃣  **Pegged Bridges:**  These bridges create “copies” of tokens on another blockchain, pegged to the value of the original. They offer wider accessibility but come with potential risks linked to maintaining the peg value.  **_WBTC_** _is an example of a pegged bridge._

9️⃣  **Atomic Swaps:**  These bridges facilitate direct peer-to-peer exchanges, eliminating the need for intermediaries. It’s like two people directly swapping tokens across blockchains without trusting a third party.  _An example is_ **_AtomicDEX_**_._

# How do Blockchain Bridges Work? 🤔

Here’s a simplified explanation of how they typically operate:

Blockchain Bridges

## 👉 Initiation

-   The process begins when a user initiates a transaction to transfer assets from one blockchain to another.
-   The user specifies the assets they want to transfer and the recipient’s address on the destination blockchain.

## 👉 Locking Assets on the Original Blockchain

-   To start the transfer, the user locks the assets they want to transfer on the original blockchain.
-   This involves sending the assets to a specific address or  **smart contract**  controlled by the blockchain bridge.
-   The locking process ensures that the assets are securely held and cannot be accessed until the transfer is completed.

## 👉 Confirmation and Verification

-   The blockchain bridge confirms the transaction and verifies the availability of the locked assets.
-   Validators or nodes on the original blockchain validate the transaction and ensure that the assets are locked and ready for transfer.

## 👉 Representation Creation on the Destination Blockchain

-   Once the  [**locking process**](https://atomyze.us/locking-mechanism-for-data-blocks-on-a-blockchain/)  is confirmed, the blockchain bridge creates a representation of the locked assets on the destination blockchain.
-   This representation can take the form of tokens or other digital assets that mirror the locked assets on the original blockchain.

## 👉 Transfer Initiation

-   With the representation of the assets established on the destination blockchain, the transfer process is initiated.
-   The blockchain bridge securely transfers the representation of the assets to the recipient’s address on the destination blockchain.

## 👉 Verification and Consensus

-   Validators or nodes on both blockchains verify the transaction and reach a consensus on its validity.
-   This consensus ensures that the transfer is executed accurately and securely across both blockchains.

## 👉 Unlocking Assets on the Destination Blockchain

-   Upon successful transfer, the recipient can unlock the representation of the assets on the destination blockchain.
-   This involves confirming the receipt of the assets and unlocking them for use or further transactions on the destination blockchain.
