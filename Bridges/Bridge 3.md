1.  **Types of Crypto Bridges**:
    
    -   **Unidirectional (One-Way) Bridges**:
        -   These bridges allow you to port assets from one blockchain to another but not vice versa. For instance:
            -   **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)**: Converts Bitcoin (BTC) to an ERC-20 stablecoin on Ethereum.
    -   **Bidirectional (Two-Way) Bridges**:
        -   These bridges enable asset conversion both ways between blockchains. Examples include:
            -   **Wormhole**: Allows seamless transfer between Solana and Ethereum.
            -   **Multichain**: Facilitates asset movement across various blockchains.
    -   **Custodial (Centralized) Bridges**:
        -   These bridges involve a trusted custodian who controls bridged assets. Example:
            -   **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)**: Custodied by BitGo.
    -   **Noncustodial (Decentralized) Bridges**:
        -   These bridges use smart contracts for asset custody. Example:
            -   **Wormhole**: Assets held by the protocol itself.
2.  **Related Terms and Idioms**:
    
    -   **Interoperability**: The ability of different blockchains to communicate and share data.
    -   **Synthetic Derivatives**: Tokens representing assets from another blockchain.
    -   **Layer 2 Networks**: Faster blockchains built on top of existing ones (e.g., Arbitrum, Polygon).
    -   **ERC-20 Token**: Standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum.
    -   **Exploit**: Security vulnerability leading to unauthorized access or manipulation.
    -   **Bridge Token**: The converted asset on the target blockchain.
3.  **Popular Online Services**:
    
    -   **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)**: Custodial bridge for BTC to ERC-20 on Ethereum.
    -   **Wormhole**: Decentralized bridge for Solana and Ethereum.
    -   **Multichain**: Bidirectional bridge for various blockchains.
