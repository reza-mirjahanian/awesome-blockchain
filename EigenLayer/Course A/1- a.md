## General & Background

### **1. What is the primary goal of the Eigen Layer node operator specs?**

**Answer:**  
The main goal is to provide a standardized specification for AVS (Actively Validated Service) node software, ensuring that all node operators have a smooth experience running, managing, and monitoring nodes. By standardizing these operations, it also enables the development of CLI tools to automate and optimize node management.

---

### **2. Who collaborated to develop the node operator specs?**

**Answer:**  
The Eigen Layer team partnered with Nethermind, with significant contributions from Swapnil, Miguel, and other Nethermind members, to develop these specifications.



---

### **4. What is the current focus of the specification?**

**Answer:**  
The current version focuses on single on-premise setups (Project solar sectors). Future versions may extend to off-premise or multi-node setups.

---

### **5. What inspired the design of these specifications?**

**Answer:**  
The design is inspired by EIP-2195, which proposes standards for node software, specifically for exporting metrics and monitoring.

---

## Packaging & Installation

### **6. What technology is used for packaging and running AVS nodes according to the spec?**

**Answer:**  
Docker and Docker Compose are the main technologies used for packaging, dependency management, and running AVS nodes.

---


---

### **9. What is the role of the `tap` repository in the packaging process?**

**Answer:**  
The `tap` repository, inspired by Homebrew, acts as a central index for all AVS node packages. Developers create and maintain a tap for their project, which follows a naming pattern and structure, and submit it to the public index.

---

### **10. Which main files must be included in an AVS node package?**

**Answer:**  
- **Monitor file:** Defines node version, hardware requirements, and programs.
- **Profile file:** Contains preset configurations for different networks, e.g., mainnet or testnet.

---



---

## Node Update & Migration

### **12. How should node developers handle database version migrations?**

**Answer:**  
Node developers should use migration management systems to update database schemas, ensuring backward compatibility (especially with key-value databases like RocksDB) and smooth transitions between versions.

---

### **13. What is the AVS Setup Wizard Tool and what does it do?**

**Answer:**  
It’s a tool (in development) to simplify node upgrades, rollbacks, and configuration through a single command. It also provides backup before updating, ensuring data safety.

---

### **14. How should shared state between multiple services be managed?**

**Answer:**  
It’s recommended to use an event-driven architecture for managing shared state, making it easier to handle different versions of messages and data.

---

## Backup & Restore


---

### **16. How does Docker facilitate backup and restore?**

**Answer:**  
Docker containers and their volumes are self-contained, so backing up and restoring involves saving and restoring container images and data volumes, regardless of the process inside.

---

### **17. What is the potential downside of frequent backups?**

**Answer:**  
Excessive use of backups can significantly increase disk usage on the host system.

---

## Plugin System

### **18. What is the purpose of the plugin system in the node spec?**

**Answer:**  
To allow custom, node-specific actions or maintenance tasks (e.g., exporting public keys, database pruning, toggling features) without modifying the core node setup.

---

### **19. How are plugins packaged and executed?**

**Answer:**  
Plugins are local Docker images or Dockerfiles specified in the node’s manifest. When needed, the CLI tool instantiates a container from the plugin image, running it in the same Docker network as the node for secure, isolated interactions.

---

### **20. How is the relationship between plugins and node setups managed?**

**Answer:**  
There is a one-to-one relationship; a plugin instance can only access the node setup it was installed with. The CLI tool tracks this in a dedicated state directory.

---

### **21. What are some example use-cases for plugins?**

**Answer:**  
- Exporting node status/public keys for on-chain actions.
- Running maintenance tasks like database pruning.
- Enabling/disabling new node features.

---

## Monitoring & Metrics

### **22. Why is standardized monitoring important for AVS nodes?**

**Answer:**  
To avoid the fragmentation and complexity seen in Ethereum, where each client implements metrics differently, making unified monitoring difficult. Standardization ensures compatibility with monitoring tools and easier integration.

---

### **23. Which monitoring tools are recommended by the spec?**

**Answer:**  
Prometheus for collecting metrics and Grafana for dashboards.

---

### **24. What does the metrics specification require each AVS node to implement?**

**Answer:**  
- An HTTP API with five endpoints, including a health check.
- Standard Prometheus metrics with an `eigen_` prefix for economic, performance, and RPC metrics.

---

### **25. What are the three standard economic metrics specified?**

**Answer:**  
- **Total fees earned** by the node, per token.
- **Total slashing incurred** by the node, per token.
- **Node’s total balance** in a specific token.

---

### **26. How is node performance measured in the spec?**

**Answer:**  
Through a performance score metric (0–100), calculated by the AVS developer based on their criteria.

---

### **27. What are the two standard RPC metrics?**

**Answer:**  
Metrics tracking the number and types of RPC requests handled by the node.

---

### **28. Why is the health check endpoint important?**

**Answer:**  
It enables load balancers, Kubernetes clusters, and other orchestration tools to quickly assess the node’s status and automate responses to failures.

---

### **29. How does the spec enable easy integration with existing infrastructure?**

**Answer:**  
By using standard, widely-adopted tools (Prometheus, Grafana) and a common set of metrics, integrating new AVS nodes into existing monitoring setups requires minimal changes.

---

## Key/Secret Management

### **30. Why is key management critical for AVS node operators?**

**Answer:**  
Improper key management can lead to lost funds, inability to operate nodes, or security breaches. Most losses stem from hardware failure or inadequate backup practices.

---

### **31. What are some recommended methods for loading secrets/keys into a node?**

**Answer:**  
- **Pathway prompt:** User enters the secret, which should not be persisted.
- **Keystore/password file:** User provides a path to a file, which is more secure.
- **Remote decryption:** Key is stored encrypted locally and decrypted with a remote key.
- **Remote signers:** Use external signers (e.g., Web3Signer) to delegate signing operations.

---

### **32. What is the best practice for storing keys for large-scale operators?**

**Answer:**  
Use enterprise-grade secret managers like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault, and split mnemonic seeds if operating a large number of validators.

---

### **33. What is the danger of storing secrets directly in the terminal buffer?**

**Answer:**  
Terminal buffers can be persisted and searched by attackers, so secrets entered this way may be exposed if not handled securely.

---

### **34. What approach is recommended for handling dynamic key changes?**

**Answer:**  
Nodes should listen for changes in the keystore folder and handle key changes dynamically, without requiring a node restart.

---

### **35. What are the security recommendations for users managing their own keys?**

**Answer:**  
- Store keys and backups offline in physically secure locations.
- Use strong backup and recovery procedures.
- Recognize that most losses are due to hardware loss, not attacks.

---

## Advanced Operator Considerations

### **36. How can the spec accommodate Kubernetes environments?**

**Answer:**  
By generating Helm charts from Docker Compose files or allowing AVS developers to provide their own Helm charts, though this may be complex for some developers.

---

### **37. Can AVS nodes access remote databases such as AWS RDS?**

**Answer:**  
Yes, if the Docker network has internet access and the remote service is configured to accept connections.

---

### **38. Is support for distro-less Docker images planned?**

**Answer:**  
It depends on whether the image can run correctly on a Linux host. Multi-architecture support should be specified in the package.

---

### **39. Can node upgrades be made “slashable” offenses or synchronized with slashing conditions?**

**Answer:**  
The preferred approach is to require software upgrades before a defined fork or event, similar to Ethereum. Software must be upgraded in advance but continue old behavior until the fork triggers.

---

### **40. Where does responsibility for database schema migrations lie?**

**Answer:**  
With the node developer. The node software should confirm successful migration and revert if it fails, as not all AVS nodes use relational databases.

---

### **41. How should migration tools be provided to operators?**

**Answer:**  
As plugins or containers invoked by the update process, ensuring seamless integration with the node’s lifecycle.

---

## Technical Details & Best Practices

### **42. What are the benefits of the plugin system running within the same Docker network as the node?**

**Answer:**  
It allows plugins to securely interact with node services without exposing them to the host or other networks.

---

### **43. How are updates to node packages managed in the tap repository?**

**Answer:**  
By committing updated files and tagging the release. Tools can subscribe to these tags for automated updates.

---



---

### **47. What are the core principles for plugin images?**

**Answer:**  
- Local image storage.
- Execution within the node’s Docker network.
- Secure, isolated interaction with node services.

---

### **48. What is the recommended way for users to recover from a failed update?**

**Answer:**  
Use the backup/restore system to revert to the previous node version and data state.

---

### **49. What is the impact of backup/restore on disk usage and how should it be managed?**

**Answer:**  
Frequent backups increase disk usage, so operators should manage backup retention and disk capacity appropriately.

---

### **50. How does the spec handle node versioning and upgrades with respect to slashing and forks?**

**Answer:**  
Nodes must be upgraded before a specified fork or event, allowing time for all operators to update. The software maintains backward compatibility until the fork, then switches to new logic.

---

## Miscellaneous

### **51. What is the process for AVS developers to register their package in the public index?**

**Answer:**  
Create a pull request to the public tap repository to register the package, although this is not mandatory.

---

### **52. What is the role of the “dashboard” folder in the package structure?**

**Answer:**  
It contains Grafana dashboard configurations and panels tailored for monitoring that specific node.

---

### **53. How can operators customize monitoring and alerting?**

**Answer:**  
By importing or modifying Grafana dashboards provided by AVS developers and setting up alerts on relevant metrics.

---

### **54. What is the recommended mnemonic handling strategy for large-scale validators?**

**Answer:**  
Split keys across multiple mnemonics, e.g., one mnemonic per 200–1000 validator keys, for security and easier management.
